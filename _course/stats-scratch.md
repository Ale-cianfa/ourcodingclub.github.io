# Stream overview

__This stream is aimed at scientists who are looking to learn the R language for data manipulation and statistical analysis.__ No programming experience required, so it is ideal for students, postgraduate researchers, and anyone who has been using commercial software for data analysis and wishes they could have more flexibility in their analyses!

We will teach you the basic syntax of the R language, and right away you'll be using it to import, manipulate and plot data. You will get into the good habit of using scripts to write clear and reproducible code, and learn the most efficient tricks to prepare and tidy data for analysis in R. We will use a variety of ecological data to practice making graphs and running linear models. Soon you will have all the skills you need to analyse your own data and present the results in a professional way!

# Challenge yourself

Have you completed all the tutorials you wanted to? Feel you're ready for some real-life applications? We encourage you to test your skills and take the challenge associated to this stream.

Our case-study challenges are designed to test the range of skills you gained throughout the course. We provide guidance but no step-by-step instructions, so your solution will be unique! A challenge might take you 4-8 hours to complete (get in touch if you get stuck!). The button below will take you to the challenge page where you can see what is required.
