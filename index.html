            <h2>About Us</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Our team includes undergradute students, graduates, PhD students, and lecturers. We are all passionate for good teaching and improving quantitative skills. We believe that coding can be really fun and also understand the importance of quantitative skills for professional development. <b>We organise weekly workshops, complemented by online materials (workshop instructions available on this website and all files necessary to complete them are on <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub">our GitHub account</a>).</b> Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of R knowledge. Our mission is to create a diverse learning community where we help each other to attain fluency in statistics and programming - if you would like to join us or learn more, please email <b>ourcodingclub@gmail.com</b>.  </p>

      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GOOD TEACHING, INNOVATION AND GREAT IDEAS</h2>
      <p>We want to design innovative ways to teach statistics and programming - our plans so far include games, team challenges and lots of group work. <b>We envision Coding Club as a place to generate new ideas and innovative ways to address exciting questions in ecology and environmental sciences.</b> Although our own work focuses on ecology and environmental science, the learning materials we create are easily transferable to other disciplines.</p>
      <p>Some of the themes we will be covering in our weekly workshops include how to write reproducible code, create beautiful and informative figures, and use different type of models (e.g. mixed effects and mixture models). We will be using R, Markdown, Shiny, our favourite packages such as dplyr and ggplot2, and much more - we are always open to new ideas and want to keep Coding Club current and ever evolving.</p>

        <h2>OUR VALUES AND GOALS</h2>
        <p><big><b>Coding Club is for everyone keen to learn about programming and statistics and how these skills can be applied in ecological and environmental research. We want to create a vibrant and diverse community where everyone has a voice and feels comfortable to express it. Our own team includes people from different backgrounds and nationalities and we are so happy to be working together. We want to establish the same ethos within Coding Club as a whole - Coding Club is a place that brings people together, regardless of their gender or background. We all have the right to learn, and we believe learning is more fun and efficient when we help each other along the way.</b></big></p>
