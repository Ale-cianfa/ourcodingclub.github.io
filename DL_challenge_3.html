      <h2>Challenge outline and objectives</h2>
      <p>The Isle of May, located on the east coast of Scotland, is a nature reserve home to large colonies of seabirds. A long-term monitoring programme is in place, and every year, scientists and volunteers record information about the abundance, breeding success, and diet of seabirds such as puffins, fulmars, kittiwakes, shags, guillemots, and razorbills. There is concern that with changing climate, the abundance of sandeels (and the plankton upon which they depend), a favourite food resource for birds, will decrease or shift temporally so that the availability will be reduced at the critical time of breeding and chick rearing. </p>
      
<p>Your mission will be to analyse the breeding success and return rates compiled and summarised by the <a href = "http://ceh.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Center for Ecology and Hydrology</a> to assess the health of these seabird populations. You will look for temporal trends, but also for environmental factors which may influence the survival and breeding of the birds.</p>

<p>This challenge builds on data manipulation, data visualisation and modelling skills. See below (internal link) for a list of tutorials you may want to refer to. </p>

         <center><h2>Data overview </h2></center>
         
          <p> You will use the following datasets: <br> </p>
          
          <b><h3>CEH's Isle of May Long-Term Study data</h3></b>
          <br>
          <li><b>Breeding success of sea birds</b>, compiled as the number of chicks fledged per nest. Original data link <a href="(https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/02c98a4f-8e20-4c48-8167-1cd5044c4afe)" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          
           <li><b>Return rates of sea birds</b>, compiled as the proportion of birds seen in one year that returned the next : this is not exactly survival data, but can be used as a proxy. Original data link <a href="https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/53251b3c-6c79-4aeb-a0de-fc63b9350cc1" target="_blank">here</a>. </li><br>
          
          <b><h3>Climate data from the Met Office</h3></b>
          <br>
      For the East of Scotland, extracted and compiled by us. It contains: 
          <br>
<li>	minimum, mean and maximum monthly temperatures (°C)</li>
<li>	monthly sunshine (hours)</li>
<li>	monthly rainfall (mm)</li>


<p>The dataset also contains seasonal averages of these variables. Winter: Dec-Feb, Spring: Mar-May, Summer: June-Aug, Autumn: Sept-Nov. (For winter, year refers to Jan/Feb). Original data link <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

   <center><h2>Specific tasks </h2></center>
      
      <p>Here is a detailed list of the tasks you should achieve within this challenge, and the questions that will be asked in the quiz at the end to confirm your successful completion.</p>
      
   <p> <b>1. Temporal trends in breeding success</b><br></p>
      
<p>You will import the breeding success data, and plot the time series and a line of best fit for each species. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li>	Reshape the data for analysis, with a “species” column </li><br>

<li>	Created a facetted plot showing the time series and a line of best fit for each species. Be prepared to answer the question: <i>From looking at the plot, which species (2) seem to have the greatest inter-annual variability in breeding success?</i> </li><br>

<li>	Extract slopes, confidence intervals and goodness of fit information after running linear regressions for each species. (Look at the Help (INTERNAL LINK) – Hints section if you cannot find a way to automate this – you should not copy and paste your code six times!). Create a visualisation of your choice showing the slope estimate and confidence intervals for each species, so that is clear which slopes differ from zero. Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	Which species has/have experienced a significant increase? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Which species has experienced the strongest decrease?</i></li>
<li> - <i>	For which species did you get the best goodness of fit?</i></li></ul>
         </li>
   <br>
   <p> <b>2. Does climate affect breeding success? </b><br></p>
      
<p>There is growing evidence that climate change affects the dynamics of seabird populations, for instance by disrupting the timing and availability of food resources such as sandeels (and the plankton upon which eels depend). You will test whether temperature and other climatic variables at the time of nesting and chick rearing affect the breeding success.</p>

<p>First, you may assume that species might show similar responses and therefore want to predict seabird breeding success as a function of climate only, with year and species perhaps introducing some non-independence in the data. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li> Design a random-intercept mixed-model approach to answer the question, testing in turn the 3 following climate variables and comparing the results to a null model: spring max temperature (when birds arrive and lay eggs), June max temperature (when chicks hatch and are reared), and June rainfall.  </li> <br>     

<li>	Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	What are your random effects? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Which model(s) have an effect size different from zero (i.e. estimate +/- S.E. doesn’t overlap 0)? </i></li></ul>
         </li><br> 
         
<li> Optional: extract and plot the predicted values from a model of your choice using the ggeffects package, and overlay the raw data on the graph. </li> <br>

   <p> <b>3. What if species actually differ in their climate response? </b><br></p>
      
<p>Create a data visualisation that shows the data points and regression lines for each species separately. (Remember that we are working with summarised data rather than the raw data, which limits our modelling options and justifies the use of linear regression.) Specifically, you should: </p>

<li> Visualise the species-specific fledging responses to SPRING and JUNE max temperature and rainfall.  </li> <br>    
<li> Extract the slopes and confidence intervals of these linear relationships, and display them together in a single graph. (To compare effect sizes, variables must be standardised: see the HINTS section if you’re struggling.) </li> <br>

<li>	Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	For which species do sunshine hours in June have a significant positive effect? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Which variable most negatively affect puffin breeding success in Spring? </i></li></ul>
         </li><br>
