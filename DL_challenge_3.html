      <h2>Challenge outline and objectives</h2>
      <p>The Isle of May, located on the east coast of Scotland, is a nature reserve home to large colonies of seabirds. A long-term monitoring programme is in place, and every year, scientists and volunteers record information about the abundance, breeding success, and diet of seabirds such as puffins, fulmars, kittiwakes, shags, guillemots, and razorbills. There is concern that with changing climate, the abundance of sandeels (and the plankton upon which they depend), a favourite food resource for birds, will decrease or shift temporally so that the availability will be reduced at the critical time of breeding and chick rearing. </p>
      
<p>Your mission will be to analyse the breeding success and other behaviours of seabirds compiled and summarised by the <a href = "http://ceh.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Center for Ecology and Hydrology</a> to assess the health of these seabird populations. You will look for temporal trends, but also for environmental factors which may influence the breeding of the birds.</p>

<p>This challenge builds on data manipulation, data visualisation and modelling skills. See below (LINK TO SECTION) for a list of tutorials you may want to refer to. </p>

         <center><h2>Data overview </h2></center>
         
          <p> You will use the following datasets, available to download from the <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_challenge3" target="_blank">Challenge repository</a> on GitHub <br> </p>
          
          <b><h3>CEH's Isle of May Long-Term Study data</h3></b>
          
          <li><b>Breeding success of sea birds</b>, compiled as the number of chicks fledged per nest. Original data link <a href="(https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/02c98a4f-8e20-4c48-8167-1cd5044c4afe)" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          
           <li><b>Dive times and depths of auks</b> from the Isle of May outside the breeding season, obtained by fitting birds with data loggers. Original data link <a href="https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/6ab0ee70-96f8-41e6-a3e3-6f4c31fa5372" target="_blank">here</a>. </li><br>

   <!-- Tasks section -->
<section id="portfolio-work" style= "background-color: #afbdcd; color: #2b3138">

        <div class="container">
           
   <center><h2>Specific tasks </h2></center>
      
      <p>Here is a detailed list of the tasks you should achieve within this challenge, and the questions that will be asked in the quiz at the end to confirm your successful completion.</p>
      
   <h3> <b>1. Temporal trends in breeding success</b></h3>
      
<p>You will import the breeding success data, and plot the time series and a line of best fit for each species. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li>	Reshape the data for analysis, with a “species” column </li>

<li>	Created a facetted plot showing the time series and a line of best fit for each species. Be prepared to answer the question: <i>From looking at the plot, which species (2) seem to have the greatest inter-annual variability in breeding success?</i> </li>

<li>	Extract slopes, confidence intervals and goodness of fit information after running linear regressions for each species. (Look at the Help (INTERNAL LINK) – Hints section if you cannot find a way to automate this – you should not copy and paste your code six times!). Create a visualisation of your choice showing the slope estimate and confidence intervals for each species, so that is clear which slopes differ from zero. Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	Which species has/have experienced a significant increase? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Which species has experienced the strongest decrease?</i></li>
<li> - <i>	For which species did you get the best goodness of fit?</i></li></ul>
         </li>
   
   <h3><b>2. Does climate affect breeding success? </b></h3>
      
<p>There is growing evidence that climate change affects the dynamics of seabird populations, for instance by disrupting the timing and availability of food resources such as sandeels (and the plankton upon which eels depend). You will test whether temperature and other climatic variables at the time of nesting and chick rearing affect the breeding success.</p>

<p>Design a hierarchical model to test for the influence of climate on breeding success. First, you may assume that species might show similar responses and therefore want to predict seabird breeding success as a function of climate only, with other factors perhaps introducing some non-independence in the data. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li> Subset your breeding success dataset to exclude shags (if you’ve completed the first section, you probably saw that they’re not following the same trends as other species)</li>
<li> Design a random-intercept mixed-model approach to answer the question. Use June max temperature (when chicks hatch and are reared) as the explanatory variable – but feel free to experiment with other possibly meaningful climate variables.  </li>      
<li> Extract and plot the predicted values from the model using the ggeffects package, and overlay the raw data on the graph </li>
<li>	Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	What are your random effects? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Does June temperature affect the breeding success of seabirds?</i></li>
</ul>
         </li>

<p><i>Remember that we are working with summarised data rather than the raw data, which limits our modelling options. </i> The raw dataset would contain counts (integer) of actual fledglings per nest, with a row for each of the hundreds of nests surveyed.  With this in mind, have a think about:</p>
<ul>
<li> - <i>	What data distribution would you use to answer the same question as above? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	What random effect structure would you choose? </i></li>
</ul>

   <h3><b>3. Dive deeper! (Optional)</b></h3>
      
<p>The <i>Dive times and depths</i> dataset contains information about the diving behaviour of monitored seabirds. It is a fairly large dataset with some interesting features, and is therefore ideal to test your data manipulation skills. So if you feel like going further in your data wrangling and modelling journey, try to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li> - <i>	Does dive depth vary among species, and between males and females of the same species? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Does dive duration also vary? </i></li>
</ul>

<p>The dataset contains the logged start and end time of each dive – to get you started, you’ll need to convert these to POSIXct format and calculate the duration of the interval. Don’t forget to remove the obvious outliers of impossible dive times (very long or negative), probably indicative of logger failure!</p>

<p>For an extra challenge, why don’t you try answering those questions using a Bayesian framework?</p>
