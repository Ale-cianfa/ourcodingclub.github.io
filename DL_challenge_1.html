      <h2>Challenge outline and objectives</h2>
      <p> Red squirrels, once widespread throughout the UK, have declined sharply in the last century following the introduction of grey squirrels from North America. Most of the remaining populations are now restricted to parts of Scotland, and still threatened by the expansion of grey squirrels, which are more competitive and carry the deadly squirrel pox. </p> 
     
     <p> Red squirrels are a protected species and, with conservation efforts from <a href="https://scottishsquirrels.org.uk/" target="_blank">dedicated organisations</a>, are able to maintain strongholds in various parts of Scotland. These organisations also collect information on red and grey squirrel sightings, and we will use these data in the challenge to learn more about red squirrel population trends and habitat preferences.</p>

         <center><h2>Data overview </h2></center>
         
          <p> You will use the following datasets: <br> </p>
          
          <b><h3>The Scottish Squirrel Database</h3></b>

          <p>A dataset of grey and red squirrel observations compiled by the <a href="http://scottishwildlifetrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Scottish Wildlife Trust</a> and hosted on the <a href="https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/show/dr949" target="_blank">NBN Atlas</a>. The most relevant variables in the dataset for this challenge are:</p>
          <li><b>Year:</b> the year of the sighting</li>
          <li><b>Count:</b> the number of squirrels sighted on the occasion (if blank, assume it is 1)</li>
          <li><b>OSGR:</b> the Ordance Survey (LINK) grid reference for 10 x 10 km squares; will be useful to link the forest cover data</li>

          
          <b><h3>Forest cover</h3></b>

      <p>This dataset contains the forest cover (in % and total area) in each OS grid cell. This dataset was created by us*, using: </p>

<li>	<b>The National Forest Inventory for Scotland 2017</b>, from the <a href="http://data-forestry.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3cb1abc185a247a48b9d53e4c4a8be87_0/" target="_blank">Forestry Commission</a></li>

<li>	<b>OS grid cells at a 10 x 10 km resolution</b>, from <a href="https://github.com/charlesroper/OSGB_Grids" target="_blank">this Git repository</a></li>

<p>*<i>Fancy an extra challenge? Why don't you try re-creating this dataset yourself?</i> (Best suited to someone with notions of spatial analysis: all you have to do is intersect the files and extract the area.)</p>

        <div class="container">
           
   <center><h2>Specific tasks </h2></center>
      
      <p>Here is a detailed list of the tasks you should achieve within this challenge, and the questions that will be asked in the quiz at the end to confirm your successful completion.</p>
      
   <h3> <b>1. Data manipulation </b><br></h3>
      
<p>Clean the squirrel dataset for the last decade, so it’s ready to analyse. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li>	Keep only observations for the years 2008 to 2017 (using the <i>Start.date.year column</i> and renaming it to <i>year</i>)</li>

<li>Remove the observations that are not at the species level (i.e. we don’t know whether they are grey or red squirrels)</li>

<li>Create a <i>species</i> column that will have <i>Red</i> and <i>Grey</i> as factor levels </li>

<li>We will assume that the observations that have <b>NA</b> as <i>count</i> are observations of one squirrel; replace them by the value 1. </li>

<li>Be prepared to answer the question: <i>To the nearest thousand, how large is your <b>cleaned</b> dataset? </i> </li>
   
   <h3> <b>2. Temporal trends </b><br></h3>
      
<p>Determine if there is a temporal trend in the number of observations for red and grey squirrels (2008-2017). Specifically, you should:</p>

<li> Summarise the number of observations per species and per year </li>      

<li>Plot the data and run one linear model to test this</li>

<li>Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	Which species showed the strongest change over time? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	What were your predictor variable(s) and their data type in the model? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	What is the adjusted R-squared of the regression? </i></li></ul>
         </li>
         
<li> Think about the following: what could be the reasons for this trend? </li> <br>

   <h3> <b>3. Do red and grey squirrels prefer different habitats? </b><br></h3>
      
<p>Determine whether total squirrel counts (for the study period 2008-2017) in OS grid cells (10km) are linked to forest cover in the cell. Specifically, you should: </p>

<li> Summarise the squirrel count data at the species and grid cell level. Remove observations greater than 500 after aggregating, as they mess up with the plots later (but feel free to experiment with the full dataset too!).</li>    

<li>Merge the squirrel and forest datasets </li> 

<li>Visualise the scatterplot of abundance as a function of forest cover for each species. Run one linear model to test the relationship. </li>

<li>	Be prepared to answer the questions: 
<ul>
<li> - <i>	Is the relationship significant? </i></li>
<li> - <i>	Does the model explain the variation in the data well?</i></li></ul>
         </li>
         
 <h3> <b>4. Re-classify forest cover </b><br></h3>         
         
<p>Building on the previous point, try turning the forest cover data into a categorical variable, and use the visual representation of your choice to display the median abundance and uncertainty around this measure. Specifically, you should:</p> 

<li>	Transform the cover data into a <i>cover.class</i> variable with the following bins:
<ul>
<li>o [0-10] % </li>
<li>o	]10-20]</li>
<li>o	]20-30]</li>
<li>o	]30-40]</li>
<li>o	]40-50]</li>
<li>o	]50+</li>

</ul>
         </li>
         
<li>	Create your visualisation and be ready to answer the question: <i>In what cover classes are red squirrels more abundant than grey?</i> </li>
