### What is version control?

Version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore what changes you have made, be it data, coding scripts, or papers. You are probably already doing some type of version control, if you save multiple files, such as `Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R`, `Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R`, etc. This approach will leave you with tens, or hundreds, of similar files, it makes it rather cumbersome to directly compare different versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software such as <a href = "https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, version control is much smoother and easier to implement. Using an online platform like <a href = "https://github.com/">Github</a> to store your files also means that you have an online back up of your work, so you won't need to panic when your laptop dies or files mysteriously disappear.

There are several excellent guides on version control using git that provide an in-depth introduction (e.g. <a href = "http://simon-m-mudd.github.io/NMDM_book/#_version_control_with_git">Prof Simon Mudd's Numeracy, Modelling and Data management guide</a> and this <a href = "https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Software Carpentry guide</a>). You can also check out <a href = "https://github.com/BES2016Workshop/version-control">this guide on using git through the command line and through RStudio </a> from the British Ecological Society Version Control workshop. We encourage you to look through those later, to get more comfortable with version control, using the command line and Github, but until then, here we offer a gentle introduction to syncing RStudio and Github, so you can start using version control in minutes.

If you haven't already done so, please register on the <a href = "https://github.com/">Github website</a> and download <a href = "https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a>, which automatically downloads git for you as well.


#### What is a repository?
You can think of a repository (_aka_ a repo) as a "master folder" - a repository can have folders within it, or be just separate files. In any case, a repository is what holds all of the files associated with a certain project.

### Using RStudio and Github together

Log into your Github account and navigate to <a href = "https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-7-Github">the repository for this workshop </a>. Click `Fork` - this means you are making a copy of this repository for yourself - think of it as a working copy.

This is a tiny repo, so forking it will only take a few seconds, note that when working with lots of data, it can take a while. Once the forking is done, you will be automatically redirected to your forked copy of the `CC-7-Github` repo. Notice that now the repo is located within your own Github account - e.g. where you see "gndaskalova", you should see your name.

Click `Clone or download` and if you are on a Windows computer, copy the HTTPS link (that's the one that automatically appears in the box). If you have a Mac, click on `Use SSH` and copy that link.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/link.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/></center>

Now open RStudio, click `File/ New Project/ Version control/ Git` and paste the link you copied from Github. Select a directory on your computer - that is where the "local" copy of your repository will be (the online one being on Github). Once the files have finished copying across, you will notice that a few things about your RStudio session have changed.

Once the files have finished copying across, you will notice that a few things about your RStudio session have changed:

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/git.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1200px;"/></center>

You are now ready to start making changes and documenting them through Github! Open the `Sample_script.R` file - there is a simple task outlined, just so that you can make changes to the script and see how they are reflected on Github. Load in the data file `temp_elevation.csv` and make a plot that shows how soil temperature changes with elevation. Try to make the plot on your own with `ggplot2` and come back to this code if you get stuck.

```r
(temp.el <- ggplot (temp_elevation, aes(x = Elevation.m, y = Soil.temp.mean)) +
  geom_point(colour = "#8B4513") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, colour = "#8B4513", fill = "#8B4513", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (m)", y = "Mean soil temperature (Â°C)") +
  theme.clean())
```

Save your plot in the project directory (that is the directory that it will automatically get saved into) and click `File / Save` to save the changes you have made to the script. If you click on the `Git` tab you will see that now there are four files there - a .gitignore file, an .Rproj file, your plot and your script. Tick them all. The .gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore and not put up on Github - you can leave that as it is and not worry about it, since we want all of our files uploaded. The plot file will have an `A` - you have added that script, whereas the script file has an `M` - this file you have modified. If you select the script file and click on `Diff`, you will see the changes you have made. Make sure that all of your files are selected - they are now `staged`, ready to be commited to Github.

Click on `Commit` and add in your `Commit message` - aim to be concise and informative - what did you do? Once you have clicked on `Commit`, you will get a message about what changes you have made.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/git3.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1200px;"/></center>

You will also see a message saying that your branch is now one commit ahead of the `origin/master` branch - that is the branch that is on Github - we now need to let Github know about the changes we have made.

It is good practice to always `Pull` before you `Push` - `Pull` means that you are pulling the most recent of the Github repository onto your local branch - this command is especially useful if several people are working within the same repository - imagine there was a second script examining soil pH along this elevation gradient, and your collaborator was working on it the same time as you - you wouldn't want to "overwrite" their work and cause trouble. In this case, you are the only one working on these files, but it's still good to develop the practice of pulling before you push. Once you've pulled, you'll see a message that you are already up to date, you can now push! Click on `Push`, wait for the loading to be over and then click on `Close` - that was it, you have successfully pushed your work to Github!

Go back to your repository on Github, where you can now see all of your files (your new plot included) online.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/git5.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1200px;"/></center>

Click on your script file and then on `History` - this is where you can see the different versions of your script - obviously in real life situations you will make many changes as your work progresses - here we just have two. Thanks to Github and version control, you don't need to save hundreds of almost identical files (e.g. `Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R`, `Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R`) - you have one file and by clicking on the different commits, you can see what it looked like at different points in time.

<b>So far we have used version control for a repository that already existed, the Coding Club practice repo, but what about if you want to create a project about your own work and use version control?</b>

Go back to RStudio, click `File/ New Project/ New directory/ Empty project`. Add a project name, select a filepath for the project and make sure that `Create a git repository` is clicked. Afterwards you can save your scripts, plots, data files, etc. to your new project directory and follow the same workflow as outlined above - stage your files, commit, pull, push.
