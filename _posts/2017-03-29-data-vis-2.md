### Tutorial Aims:

#### <a href="#ggplot"> 1. Create and customise figures in `ggplot2` </a>

#### <a href="#mixed"> 2. Plot results from mixed effects models </a>

__Following from our first tutorial on [intro to data visualisation using `ggplot2`](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/29/datavis.html), we are now back for more `ggplot2` practice and customisation. The ultimate aim of this tutorial is to help you to make your figures even more beautiful - and even more informative! Since, unfortunately, it seems to be the case that no two figures are ever the same, that means that the ability to customise figures is key!__

We will use made-up data consisting of the abundance and height of different plant species occurring in two magic lands - Hogsmeade and Narnia. The imaginary data for this tutorial can be downloaded from [this repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-10-DataVis2). Clone and download the repo as a zipfile, then unzip and set the folder as your working directory by running the code below (subbing in the actual folder path), or clicking `Session/ Set Working Directory/ Choose Directory` from the RStudio menu.

Alternatively, you can fork [the repository](https://github.com/ourcodingclub/data-vis-2) to your own Github account and then add it as a new RStudio project by copying the HTTPS/SSH link. For more details on how to register on Github, download Git, sync RStudio and Github and use version control, please check out our previous <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">tutorial.</a>

Make a new script file using `File/ New File/ R Script` and we are all set to explore how plant communities have changed in our magical lands - Hogsmeade and Narnia.

```r
# Load libraries ----
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation
library(ggplot2)  # For data visualisation
library(nlme)  # For mixed effects models

setwd("PATH_TO_FOLDER")  # Set to the folder where you saved the data

# Read in data ----
magic_veg <- read.csv("magic_veg.csv")
```

We will first explore our dataset using the `str()` function which shows what type each variable is - what is the dataset made of?

```r
str(magic_veg)

# land - the location within the land of magic (two possible lands, Narnia and Hogsmeade)
# plot - the plot number within each land
# year - the year the measurement was taken
# species - the species name (or code) - note that these are fake species!
# height - the imaginary canopy height at that point
# id - the id of each observation
```

<a name="ggplot2"></a>

## 1. Create and customise figures in `ggplot2`

We'll start by revisiting some of the types of plots we can make with `ggplot2`.

### Histograms / bar charts

```r
# First we want to know how many species there are in each plot:
species_counts <- magic_veg %>%
  group_by(land, plot) %>%
  summarise(Species_number = length(unique(species)))

ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_bw()
```

This is the common way of making a histogram, but you can immediately see that it doesn't look right.  That's because you want to tell R that you already know how many species are in each plot. You do that using this code:

```r
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw()
```

That looks a bit better, but it still seems to have far too many species. That's because plots from each land are being grouped together. We can separate them like this:

```r
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw()

# But we probably want them side by side
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw()
```

The next elements we can customise are the title, axis labels, and axis ticks - notice that we only see a few of them now.

```r
# Title and axis labels
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Species richness by plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Plot number", y = "Number of Species")

# Add all the axis ticks, because we want to know all the plots
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Species richness by plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Plot number", y = "Number of Species") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6)
```

Here is the journey of our barchart so far:

__For our final adjustments, we can customise the colours and legend:__

```r
# Customise the legend and colours
ggplot(species_counts, aes(x = plot, y = Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Species richness by plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Plot number", y = "Number of Species") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple","forestgreen"),  # Here you can set your colours
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade","Narnia"),  # Here you tell it the order of the original legend items
                    name="Lang of magic",  # Here you can give the legend a title
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia"))+
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +  # Make the title bold
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Here is the finished result:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hist7.png" alt="Img" style="width: 700px;"/> </center>

### Boxplots

We could also plot the data using box plots. That sometimes looks better as it makes more efficient use of space than bars and can reflect errors in nice ways. For this we will slightly reshape the dataset to take account of year as well. For more information on data manipulation using `dplyr` and pipes `%>%`, you can check out our [data formatting and manipulation tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html).

```r
yearly_counts <- magic_veg %>%
  group_by(land, plot, year) %>%  # We've added in year here
  summarise(Species_number = length(unique(species))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(plot = as.factor(plot))

# Plot the basic box plot
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(plot, Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```

This does a much nicer job of showing which plots are the most species rich. We can add the beautifying customisations to this exactly as above:

```r
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(plot, Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Species richness by plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Plot number", y = "Number of Species") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple","forestgreen"),
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade","Narnia"),
                    name="Land of magic",
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/boxplotall.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>

We might want to reorder the bars by some other variable - for example, median species richness. We can reorganise right in the graph:

```r
ggplot(yearly_counts, aes(reorder(plot, -Species_number, median), Species_number, fill = land)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Species richness by plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Plot number", y = "Number of Species") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple","forestgreen"),
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade","Narnia"),
                    name="Land of magic",
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/boxplot3.png" alt="Img" style="width: 700px;"/> </center>

<a name="mixed"></a>

## Plot results from mixed effects models

We are now going to look at another aspect of the data - the plant heights. First there is a little bit of data manipulations to extract just the height variables:

```r
heights<- magic_veg %>%
  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%  
  group_by(year, land, plot, id) %>%
  summarise(Max_Height = max(height)) %>%  # Calculating max height
  ungroup() %>%  # Need to ungroup so that the pipe doesn't get confused
  group_by(year, land, plot) %>%
  summarise(Height = mean(Max_Height))  # Calculating mean max height
```

We can view this as a basic scatterplot in `ggplot2`:

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

#You can see there are pretty clear trends over time. We can try to plot a simple line through this:
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

However, perhaps this isn't what we really want, because you can see the relationship isn't linear. An alternative would be to use a different smoothing equation. Here we've used a quadratic fit - something slightly more complicated to produce than the standard fits provided by R. Thankfully `ggplot2` lets us customise to pretty much any type of fit we want as we can add in an equation to tell it what to plot. There are also loads of different base fits available, you can check out some [here.](http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-can-i-explore-different-smooths-in-ggplot2/)

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height, colour = land)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2))
```

That looks better. But what if we want to run a mixed model to account for the fact that the data are nested (species within plots within magic lands) and come from different years? For an introduction to linear mixed effects modelling, [check out our tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/15/mixed-models.html). For now, A basic mixed model would look like:

```r
# Using the square brackets to subset the data just for Hogsmeade
lm_heights<-lme(Height ~ year, random = ~1|year/plot, data = heights[heights$land == "Hogsmeade",])
summary(lm_heights)

# Using the square brackets to subset the data just for Narnia
lm_heights2<-lme(Height ~ year, random = ~1|year/plot, data = heights[heights$land == "Narnia",])
summary(lm_heights2)
```

We can't directly plot these models onto the graph, so we need to calculate the predictions that the model has made first. Then we can use those predictions to tell `ggplot2` where to plot the line and the band with the errors. Calculating predictions from your mixed model fit looks really complicated, but really you are just building an empty data frame of all your variables and then using your mixed model to fill it in. The code to do that has to go through several stages and introduces a few scary looking objects, but so long as you make sure the names are consistent you don't need to worry too much about what they are.

__`%*%` is the matrix multiplication operator - you can check out [this webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) for more info on matrix multiplication. In brief, to calculate the model predictions we have two matrices and we want to multiply the values from one of columns in the first one by a certain column in the second one (the effect sizes). `plo` refers to the lower end of the uncertainty measure (in our case errors) and `phi` refers to the upper end.__

```r
# Predictions for Hogsmeade
mm.heights <- expand.grid(year = seq(1999, 2016, 1), Height = 0)  # Create a blank dataset with the years we want
mm <- model.matrix(terms(lm_heights), mm.heights)  # Create matrix of relevant effect sizes
mm.heights$Height <- mm %*% fixef(lm_heights)  # Calculate height based on the relevant effect sizes
pvar.mm.heights <- diag(mm %*% tcrossprod(vcov(lm_heights), mm))
mm.heights <- data.frame(mm.heights, plo = mm.heights$Height-1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights),
                         phi = mm.heights$Height+1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights))  # Add errors

# Predictions for Narnia
mm.heights2 <- expand.grid(year = seq(1999, 2016, 1), Height = 0)  # Create a blank dataset with the years we want
mm2 <- model.matrix(terms(lm_heights2), mm.heights2)  # Create matrix of relevant effect sizes
mm.heights2$Height <- mm2 %*% fixef(lm_heights2)  # Calculate height based on the relevant effect sizes
pvar.mm.heights2 <- diag(mm2 %*% tcrossprod(vcov(lm_heights2), mm2))
mm.heights2 <- data.frame(mm.heights2, plo = mm.heights2$Height-1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights2),
                          phi = mm.heights2$Height+1.96*sqrt(pvar.mm.heights2))  # Add errors
```

__We are now ready to add the line and error for the models to the figure:__

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi)) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi)) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_point(data = heights, aes(colour = factor(land))) +
  theme_bw()
```

Here is how our scatterplot has changed so far:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/scatterall.png" alt="Img" style="width: 1000px;"/> </center>


However, we want it to look much prettier, so we will do a new more adjustments.

```r
ggplot(heights, aes(year, Height)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi),
              fill = "purple", alpha = 0.4) +  # Change to coluor and transparency of the error ribbon
  geom_line(data = mm.heights, mapping = aes(x = year),
            colour = "purple", size = 1.5) +  # Change the colour and size of the model line
  geom_ribbon(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year, ymin = plo, ymax = phi), fill = "forestgreen", alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(data = mm.heights2, mapping = aes(x = year), colour = "forestgreen", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(data = heights, aes(colour = factor(land)), alpha = 0.6) +  # Add some transparency to the data points
  theme_bw()  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2004, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016)) +  # Add all the years
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("purple", "forestgreen"),
                    breaks = c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia"),
                    name="Land of magic",
                    labels=c("Hogsmeade", "Narnia")) +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +  # Make the title bold
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "year", y = "Mean Canopy Height") +
  ggtitle ("Change in canopy heights from 1999 - 2016 in the land of magic")
```

### Making your own `ggplot2` theme:

You might have noticed that the lines starting with `theme()` quickly pile up - you can also adjust the font size of the axes and the labels, the position of the title, the background colour of the plot, you can remove the grid lines in the background, etc. And then you have to do the same for the next plot, which really increases the amount of code you use. Here is a simple solution - create a customised theme that combines all the `theme()` elements you want, and apply it to your graphs to make things easier and increase consistency. You can include as many elements in your theme as you want, as long as they don't contradict one another, and then when you apply your theme to a graph, only the relevant elements will be considered - e.g. for our histograms we won't need to use `legend.position`, but it's fine to keep it in the theme, in case any future graphs we apply it to do have the need for legends.

```r
theme_coding <- function(){
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=12, angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1),
        axis.text.y=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title.x=element_text(size=14, face="plain"),
        axis.title.y=element_text(size=14, face="plain"),
        panel.grid.major.x=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y=element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y=element_blank(),
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), units = , "cm"),
        plot.title = element_text(size=20, vjust=1, hjust=0.5),
        legend.text = element_text(size=12, face="italic"),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position=c(0.9, 0.9))
}
```

You can try out the effects of the theme by replacing all the code starting with `theme(........)` with just `theme_coding()`.

### Picking colours using the `Rcolourpicker` addin
Setting custom colours for your graphs can set them apart from all the rest (we all know what the default `ggplot2` colours look like!), make them prettier, and most importantly, give your work a consistent and logical colour scheme. Finding the codes, e.g. `colour="#8B5A00"`, for your chosen colours, however, can be a bit tedious. Though one can always use Paint / Photoshop / google colour codes, there is a way to do this within RStudio thanks to the addin `colourpicker`. RStudio addins are installed the same way as packages, and you can access them by clicking on `Addins` in your RStudio menu. To install `colourpicker`, run the following code:

```r
install.packages("colourpicker")
```

To find out what is the code for a colour you like, click on `Addins/Colour picker`.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/colourpicker.png" alt="Img" style="width: 800px;"/></center>

When you click on `All R colours` you will see lots of different colours you can choose from - a good colour scheme makes your graph stand out, but of course, don't go crazy with the colours. When you click on `1`, and then on a certain colour, you fill up `1` with that colour, same goes for `2`, `3` - you can add mode colours with the `+`, or delete them by clicking the bin. Once you've made your pick, click `Done`. You will see a line of code `c("#8B5A00", "#CD8500")` appear - in this case, we just need the colour code, so we can copy that, and delete the rest.

## Challenge

If you are keen for more practice, you can try visualising the raw data and the predictions from a mixed effect model examining how bare ground cover has changed in our magic lands.

```r
# This is a start to extract the bareground cover data
bareground <- magic_veg %>%
  filter(species == "XXXbareground") %>%
  group_by(land, plot, year) %>%
  summarise(bareground_points = length(species))
```
