In this tutorial, we will discuss the best ways to record and store data and then learn how to format your datasets in R and to apply series of functions in an efficient way using pipes `%>%`.

__Haven't used R or RStudio before? No worries! Check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/13/intro-to-r.html" target="_blank">Intro to R and RStudio tutorial</a> and then come back here to master piping and tidy data management!__

<a name="tidy"></a>

## 1. Understand the format required for analyses in R and how to achieve it

The way you record information in the field or in the lab is probably very different to the way you want your data entered into R. In the field, you want tables that you can ideally draw up ahead and fill in as you go, and you will be adding notes and all sorts of information in addition to the data you want to analyse. For instance, if you monitor the height of seedlings during a factorial experiment using warming and fertilisation treatments, you might record your data like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig1.png" alt="Img" style="width: 500px;"/> </center>

Let's say you want to run a test to determine whether warming and/or fertilisation affected seedling growth. You may know how your experiment is set up, but R doesn't! At the moment, with 8 measures per row (combination of all treatments and species for one replicate, or block), you cannot run an analysis. On the contrary, 
<a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10" target="_blank">tidy datasets</a> are arranged so that each **row** represents an **observation** and each **column** represents a **variable**. In our case, this would look something like this:

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/SAB_fig2.png" alt="Img" style="width: 400px;"/> </center>

This makes a much longer dataframe row-wise, which is why this form is often called *long format*. Now if you wanted to compare between groups, treatments, species, etc., R would be able to split the dataframe correctly, as each grouping factor has its own column. 

The `gather()` function from the `tidyr` package lets you convert a wide-format table to a tidy dataframe. 


``` r
install.packages("tidyr")  # install the package
library(tidyr)  # load the package

elongation <- read.csv("EmpetrumElongation.csv", sep = ";")  
# load the data (annual stem growth of crowberry on sand dunes)

head(elongation)  
# preview the data 
# notice how the annual measurements are in different columns 
# even though they represent a same variable (growth)?

elongation_long <- gather(elongation, Year, Length, 
                          c(X2007, X2008, X2009, X2010, X2011, X2012))  
# gather() works like this: (data, key, value, columns to gather) 
# Here we want the lengths (value) to be gathered by year (key) 
# Note that you are completely making up the names of the second and third arguments, unlike most functions in R

elongation_wide <- spread(elongation_long, Year, Length) 
# spread() is the reverse function, allowing you to go from long to wide format

```

However, these functions will not work on every data structure. To quote <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a>, <b>"every messy dataset is messy in its own way"</b>. This is why giving a bit of thought to your dataset structure *before* doing your digital entry can spare you a lot of frustration later! *Can you think of an example in which those functions won't work?*

Once you have the data in the right format, it's much easier to analyse them and visualise the results. For example, if we want to find out if there is inter-annual variation in the growth of <i>Empetrum hermaphroditum</i>, we can quickly make a boxplot:

```r
boxplot(Length ~ Year, data = elongation_long, 
        xlab = "Year", ylab = "Elongation (cm)", 
	main = "Annual growth of Empetrum hermaphroditum")
```

<center> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Rplot.png" alt="Img" style="width: 600px;"/> </center>
Figure 1. Annual growth of <i>Empetrum hermaphroditum</i>.

From looking at the boxplot, there is a fairly big overlap between the annual growth in each year, but has growth varied significantly during the study period? We'll find out how to test this in our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/28/modelling.html" target="_blank">modelling tutorial!</a> We also have tutorials on <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/29/datavis.html" target="_blank">data visualisation</a>, where you will learn how to make boxplots like the one above and many other types of graphs in a beautiful and organised way. But first, we need to learn how to efficiently sort through our data.

<a name="dplyr"></a>

## 2. Use efficient tools for manipulating your data 

You have a nice and tidy dataset imported in R, but there are still things you want to change. We will take a look at the package `dplyr`, which is formed of a few simple, yet powerful functions to manipulate your data. Today, we will take a look at **`filter()`**, **`select()`**, **`mutate()`**, **`summarise()`** and **`group_by()`**. 


**`filter()`** is a subsetting function that allows you to select only certain **rows** in your dataframe.


``` r
install.packages("dplyr")  # install the package
library(dplyr)  # load the package

germination <- read.csv("Germination.csv", sep = ";")  
# load the data (germination of seeds subjected to different toxic solutions)

head(germination)  # preview the data

# For instance, say we only want the observations that were made for the species "SR"

germinSR <- filter(germination, Species == 'SR')
```

Once you learn the syntax of `dplyr`, it makes the code much more easily readable than if you had subsetted the same way using base R:

``` r
germinSR <- germination[germination$Species == 'SR', ]
# This is completely equivalent but soon becomes hard to read 
# if you add other conditions or have long variable names
```

And you can subset for different criteria at once:

``` r
germinSR10 <- filter(germination, Species == 'SR', Nb_seeds_germin >= 10)
# What does this do?
```
The code chunk above gives you the data for the species SR, only for observations where the number of germinated seeds was greater than 10.


The equivalent of `filter()` for columns is **`select()`**: it will keep only the variables (columns) you specify.

``` r
germin_clean <- select(germination, Species, Treatment, Nb_seeds_germin)
# This keeps only three columns in the dataframe 
# useful for cleaning out large files 
```

__Depending on which packages you have loaded in your RStudio session, you might get an error message, because RStudio gets confused when multiple packages have a command with the same name.__ The `select()` command is one of them! If the code above is not working properly, you can explicitly say that you want to use the `select()` command from the `dplyr` package. The general code for that is `package-name::command-name`:

``` r
germin_clean <- dplyr::select(germination, Species, Treatment, Nb_seeds_germin)

```

The **`mutate()`** function lets you create a new column, which is particularly useful if you want to create a variable that is a function of other variables in the dataset. For instance, let's calculate the germination percentage using the total number of seeds and the number of seeds that germinated. (Tip: you can simply give the column a name inside the function. If you don't, it will be called 'Var1' and you will have to rename it later.)

``` r
germin_percent <- mutate(germination, Percent = Nb_seeds_germin / Nb_seeds_tot * 100)

```

Another great function is **`summarise()`**, which lets you calculate summary statistics for your data. This will always return a dataframe shorter than the initial one and it is particularly useful when used with grouping factors (more on that in a minute). Let's just calculate the overall average germination percentage for now:

``` r
germin_average <- summarise(germin_percent, Germin_average = mean(Percent))
```

That's great, but that does not tell us anything about differences in germination between species and treatments. We can use the **`group_by()`** function to tell `dplyr` to create different subsets of the data (e.g. for different sites, species, etc.) and to apply functions to each of these subsets. 

``` r
germin_grouped <- group_by(germin_percent, Species, Treatment) 
# this does not change the look of the dataframe 
# but there is some grouping done behind the scenes

str(germin_grouped)
# You can see that it says the data frame is grouped

germin_summary <- summarise(germin_grouped, Average = mean(Percent))
```
What's different? Here you should end up with 6 means instead of one (one for each Species x Treatment combination). This is a simple example, but `dplyr` is very powerful and lets you deal with complex datasets in an intuitive way, especially when combined with piping. 


<a name="piping"></a>

## 3. Learn a new syntax for coding: pipes

Piping is an efficient way of writing chains of commands in a linear way, feeding the output of the first step into the second and so on, until the desired final output. It eliminates the need to create several temporary objects just to get to what you want and you can write the code as you think it, instead of having to "think backwards". 

The pipe operator is `%>%`. A pipe chain always starts with your initial **dataframe** (others objects are not allowed) and then you apply a suite of functions. You don't have to call the object every time (which means you can drop the first argument of the `dplyr` functions, or the `data = "yourdata"` argument of most functions). With pipes, the result of a function will be fed to the next command. 

Let's see how it works using the same data we worked through with `dplyr` and see how we can get to that final summary more quickly.

```r
germin_summary <- germination %>%  # this is the dataframe 
  			mutate(Percent = Nb_seeds_germin/Nb_seeds_tot * 100) %>% 
			# we are creating the percentage variable
  			group_by(Species, Treatment) %>%  
			# introducing the grouping levels
  			summarise(Average = mean(Percent),
           			  SD = sd(Percent)) %>%  
	                # calculating the summary stats; you can do several at once
			ungroup()
```
This saves the need for the temporary objects we created earlier (`germin_percent`, `germin_grouped`) and the code reads step-by-step.

## 4. Using `dplyr` to its full potential

`dplyr` is powerful package that is constantly evolving and adding new and exciting functionalities. Here are some additional ways you can handle your data!

### Filtering across multiple columns

Say, we had plotted our data and noticed there was a potential outlier. It's value seems to be `8.4`. With a large dataset, it may be tricky to find that exact point in your dataset to examine further. Here, it would be helpful to use `filter_all()`. This command will filter across all columns to find any rows with that value, regardless of what column the value is held in. 

```r

potential_outlier <- filter_all(elongation, any_vars(. == 8.4))

```

__Here we are using `.` as a "placeholder" for your data - this means that the function will be applied to all variables in your data frame object (`elongation`).__

This will return a data frame with all records that contain 8.4 in any of the columns. If you wanted to see if there were any records that contained `8.4` in every column, you could change `any_vars` to `all_vars`. 

__If you want to exclude those outliers and create a data frame without them, then you can swap the `==` with `<` - then only values smaller than `8.4` will be retained. Additionally, say you want every value but `8.4`. In that case, you can use `!=` which means that the data object will retain everything that does not match `8.4`. You can also use `!=` for categorical variables, which is quite useful when you want to exclude one or more levels of that categorical variable.__

```r

elongation_df2 <- filter_all(elongation, any_vars(. < 8.4))
elongation_df3 <- filter_all(elongation, any_vars(. != 8.4))

```

### Filtering for multiple criteria at the same time

If you don't want to filter for solely one thing, chances are you would approach it like this. 

```r

# to filter for Control and Vaccinium treatments
control_vaccinium <- filter(germination, Treatment == 'Control' | Treatment == 'Vaccinium')

```

__This would return a data frame with data regarding the "Control" and "Vaccinium" treatment types. However, since you are filtering within the same column, you don't need to keep repeating yourself! See the great shortcut below.__

```r

# to filter for Control and Vaccinium treatments efficiently 
control_vaccinium <- filter(germination, Treatment %in% c('Control', 'Vaccinium'))

```

### Summarising your data

Say your want to get a mean growth value for all years. The `summarise_all()` command would be helpful here!

```r

mean_elongation <- summarise_all(elongation, mean)

```

This would return a data frame containing a mean value for each column of data. However, this returns a mean for both the "Zone" and the "Individual" - we probably aren't interested in those means. Instead, it would be helpful to use the `summarise_at()` function to specify which columns we want to average. 

``` r

# selecting columns that contain "20" to average 
year_mean <- summarise_at(elongation, vars(contains("20")), mean)

```

We could also use `summarise_if()` to specify which type of variable we were after. For instance, if we only wanted the averages of numeric values, we could do the following:

``` r 

# compute mean for only columns with numeric data
numeric_mean <- summarise_if(germination, is.numeric, mean)

```

__This can be computed for many different functions and conditions i.e. `is.integer`. See <a href="https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/04/dplyr-tutorial-4/#summarise-all-1" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.__

### Renaming and reordering factors

__If you want to rename levels of a factor such as the Species in `germination`, you can use the following code:__

``` r
(germination$Species <- factor(germination$Species,
                        levels = c("SR", "SP"),
                        labels = c("Salix richardsonii", "Salix pulchra")))
				      				       
``` 
This not only will rename your variables from "SR" to "Salix richardsonii" for example, but also re-order them when you are graphing your data. For instance, you can specify if you want *Salix richardsonii* or *Salix pulchra* to appear first based on the order in this code. 

### Joining two datasets together

Say we wanted to combine our two datasets. Suppose the "Zone" column in `elongation` is equivalent to the "Block" column in `germination` and we want to join the datasets based on this. First, we rename "Block" to "Zone":

``` r

germination <-dplyr::rename(germination, Zone = Block)

````

Now, we can join the two datasets together.

```r 

germination2 <- inner_join(germination, elongation, by = "Zone")
View(germination2)
```

__There are a few other types of joining functions. For example, if you want to create an object with just the values that two data frames do NOT have in common, you can use `anti_join`.__

In reality, this may not be very useful for this specific dataset, but in your own work, you may have cases where this would be helpful. There are many other ways to join datasets, which are outlined <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plyr/versions/1.8.4/topics/join" target="_blank">here</a>.

Those were simple examples to get you started, but there are plenty of excellent online resources if you want to dig further - see the links below.

__Now that your data and code are tidy and organised, you can try creating <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/24/rmarkdown-1.html" target="_blank">a Markdown report of your script and results following our tutorial</a>. Your code will look even prettier and more organised and you can see your results right after the code!__
