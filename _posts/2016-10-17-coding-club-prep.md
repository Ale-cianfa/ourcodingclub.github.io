Over the summer, we have been preparing to launch Coding Club - lots of excitement and a long to do list! We are all looking forward to Coding Club - our vision of a supportive peer-to-peer learning community becoming a reality!

We have been working on grant applications, this website and most importantly, on spreading the code and stats enthusiasm among students and staff at the University of Edinburgh. I (Gergana) have been working on Coding Club in between fieldwork in Australia - it's been an interesting and fun combination of watching avian mating displays and spending many hours wondering why the code for the website is not working. Alas, the website is live and Coding Club is starting to feel real! The first workshop will take place as soon as I am back in Edinburgh, so lots of exciting events coming up in November and in the months to follow.

I'm looking forward to being reunited with the rest of the Coding Club team back in Edinburgh - brainstorming and planning will certainly be more convenient when we are on the same side of the world! Despite the distance, we have already came up with a plan for the first few workshops and have lots of ideas - what an exciting time for us all! While I am still taking in life at the Australian National University and all the sun I can, my great teammates and this poster shall be promoting Coding Club!

Our first workshop is scheduled for mid-November - if you would like to join, please email <b>ourcodingclub@gmail.com</b> - we have set up <b><a href="http://doodle.com/poll/ivksm77z6pfeupin">a doodle poll</a></b> to figure out what will be the optimal time for the workshops to take place - please vote! You can also join our mailing list - we will be sending notifications with our weekly themes - you can join in for the workshops that interest you and thus develop the skills most relevant to you! You can also follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/our_codingclub">Twitter</a>!
