In this tutorial, we are going to explore some simple __spatial analysis in R__ using
satellite data of the Loch Tay area of Scotland. Satellite or remote sensing data is increasingly used to answer ecological questions such as what are the characteristics of speciesâ€™ habitats, predicting the distribution of species and spatial variability in species richness, and detecting natural and man-made changes at scales ranging from a single valley to the entire world. Around Loch Tay, for instance, remote sensing data could be used to map different vegetation types, such as invasive species like rhododendron, and track changes over time. Alternatively, satellite data can be used to estimate forest cover for an area like Scotland and help policy makers set new targets and track progress.

R is a widely used open source programming language for data analysis
and visualisation but it is also a powerful tool to explore spatial data.
If you are not familiar with R or Rstudio, this [tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/13/intro-to-r.html){:target="_blank"}
and this [one](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/15/troubleshooting.html){:target="_blank"} are good starting points.
Reading and writing spatial data can be complicated due to the many different file formats and large size they can have. To simplify this tutorial, we will use a Sentinel 2 satellite image collected on the 27th June 2018 and downloaded from the [Copernicus Hub](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/sentinel-data-access){:target="_blank"}. This website provides free and open access to satellite data, but please note the files are very large and may take some time to download. The image used in this tutorial was cropped to reduced its size and corrected for atmospheric correction in [SNAP](http://step.esa.int/main/download/){:target="_blank"}, the free open source esa toolbox, and saved as a 'geo.TIF' file (georeferenced image) to make it easier to import. Introductory tutorials for SNAP are availlable [here](http://step.esa.int/main/doc/tutorials/snap-tutorials/){:target="_blank"}.

Alternatively, for large scale analysis where downloading huge files is not an option, the google earth engine is a powerful tool as it allows the use of the google servers. A brief tutorial can be explored [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/11/26/earth-engine.html){:target="_blank"}.

Satellite data mostly consists of __reflectance data__, which can be defined as a measure of the intensity of the reflected sun radiation by the earth's surface. Reflectance is measured for __different wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum__. The Sentinel 2 optical sensor measures reflectance at __13 wavelength bandwidths__, or bands for short. In satellite images, this data is stored in __rasters__ or matrix data structure, where __each pixel stores the data for the 13 wavelengths__. Therefore, Sentinel 2 data contains several raster layers, one for each spectral band. More information on Sentinel 2 can be access [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-2){:target="_blank"}.

## 1. Exploring Sentinel 2 raster data

Once you have unzipped the cloned repository on your computer, open `RStudio`, create a new script by clicking on `File/ New File/ R Script`. It is always a good idea the write a header to your script with your name, data and purpose such as `Intro to spatial analysis tutorial` as shown below. Then, set the working directory to the location of the unzipped files on your computer and load the following packages, installing them if necessary:


```{r}
# Intro to spatial analysis tutorial
# Satellite data available from https://scihub.copernicus.eu/

# Maude Grenier s0804311@ed.ac.uk
# 03-12-2018
##############################################################

# Set the working directory (example)
setwd("C:/Users/name/folder/spatialR")

# Load packages

library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(rasterVis)
```
The `sp` package is central for spatial data analysis in R as it defines a set of classes to represent spatial data. Another important package for spatial analysis is the `raster` package. A raster is a __grid of equal size cells, or pixels in satellite images__ and is commonly used to __represent spatially continuous data__. The cells can have __one or more values__, or even no values for the variable of interest. In the trimed multispectral image we will be using, __each cell contains relfectance data for 12 spectral bands__ . The `raster` package has functions that allow the creation, reading, manipulation and writting of raster data. The package `rgdal` is used to read or write spatial data files and the package `raster` uses it behind the scenes.
The package `viridis` is an aesthetically pleasing colour palette visible to people with colour blindness. We will use it to plot our results as well as `ggplot`.
We will use the `raster` package to read the satellite image file and inspect its properties.

```{r}
# load data
tay <- raster('data/taycrop.tif')

# get properties of tay
tay
```

In the output, we get details of the image such as the number of bands, dimension (number of rows, columns, and cells), the extent given by the coordinate references, and the coordinate reference system (CRS) which is here the Universal Trans Mercator (UTM) with datum WGS84.


```{r}
> tay
> class       : RasterLayer
> band        : 1  (of  12  bands)
> dimensions  : 507, 848, 429936  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
> resolution  : 9.217891e-05, 9.217891e-05  (x, y)
> extent      : -4.320218, -4.242051, 56.45366, 56.50039  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
> coord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
> data source : C:\Users\maude\Desktop\sentinel2\Taycrop.tif
> names       : Taycrop

```

We can create individual raster layers for each of the spectral bands in the raster tay.

```{r}
b1 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=1)
b2 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=2)
b3 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=3)
b4 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=4)
b5 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=5)
b6 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=6)
b7 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=7)
b8 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=8)
b9 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=9)
b10 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=10)
b11 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=11)
b12 <- raster('data/taycrop.tif', band=12)
```

We can now compare two bands to see if they have the same extent, number of rows and column, projection,
resolution and origin. As can be seen below, bands 2 and 3 match.

```{r}

compareRaster(b2, b3)

# TRUE

```

The bands can be plotted using the `plot` or `image` function. Note that the `plot` function only plots 100,000 pixels
but `image` strectches the view.

```{r}

plot(b8)

image(b8)

```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/2tayplots.png" alt="Img" width="800px" /></p>

To __zoom in on the image__, after calling the function `zoom` and the band you wish to inspect, first plot the band, then
__click twice on the plot__, once on two opposite corners of the area of interest in order to create a square. The zoomed in image will be of the standard `plot` function of the band, in the terrain colour palette, even when use in a different in a different plot.


```{r}
plot(b8)
zoom(b8)    # run this line, then click twice on your plot to define a box
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/zoom1.png" alt="Img" width="400px" /></p>

<p align="center"> <img src="images/zoom2.png" alt="Img" width="400px" /></p>

Alternatively, an extent can be cropped and plotted from the plot image using the same double click method described above and the code below.

```{r}
plot(tay)
e <- drawExtent()    # run this line, then click twice on your plot to define a box
cropped_tay <- crop(b7, e)
plot(cropped_tay)
```
<a name="section2"></a>

## 2. Spectral bands visualisation

The bands can be plotted with __different colour palettes__ to improve visualisation, such as `viridis`, and saved using the code below. To view the plot without saving the image, only run the second line.

```{r}
png('tayplot.png', width = 4, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)                	# to save plot
image(b8, col= viridis_pal(option="D")(10), main="Sentinel 2 image of Loch Tay")
dev.off()         									# to save plot

```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/tayplot.png" alt="Img" width="400px" align="middle" /></p>

A useful way to visualise the satellite data is to plot a __red-green-blue plot__ of a multi-layered object for a more realistic rendition.
The layers or bands represent different bandwidth in the visible electromagnetic spectrum (corresponding to red, blue and green) and combined, create a __naturalistic colour rendition of the earth surface__. First, create a raster stack, a multi-layered raster object,
of the __red(b4), green(b3) and blue(b2) bands__.

```{r}
png('RGB.png', width = 5, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)
tayRGB <- stack(list(b4, b3, b2))              # creates raster stack
plotRGB(tayRGB, axes = TRUE, stretch = "lin", main = "Sentinel RGB colour composite")
dev.off()
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/RGB.png" alt="Img" width="400px" align="middle" /></p>

Another popular way to visualise remote sensing data is using a __false colour composite (FCC)__ where the red, green, and blue bands have been replaced in order to __accentuate vegetation__. In a FCC, the __red bands is replaced by the near infrared band (band 8 in Sentinel 2), the green band by red and the blue band by green__. This creates an image where the __vegetation stands out in red__. Check `(help(plotRGB))` for more information and other arguments for the function.

### Exercise: Create a FCC of the Loch Tay area using a raster stack.

The package `rasterVis` provides a number of ways to enhance the visualisation and analysis of raster data, as can be shown [here](https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/){:target="_blank"}. The function `levelplot` allows level and contour plots to be made of raster objects with elevation data, such as LIDAR and `plot3D` allows 3D mapping. We do not have elevation data from Sentinel 2, but the package's `gplot` function, allows us to plot a uni or multivariate raster object using ggplot. For an introduction to ggplot, look [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/29/datavis.html){:target="_blank"} or for a cheatsheet, look [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

```{r}
gplot(b8) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  coord_quickmap() +
  ggtitle("West of Loch tay, raster plot") +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_classic() +   					# removes defalut grey background
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +       # centres plot title
  theme(text = element_text(size=20),			# font size
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))  # rotates x axis text

ggsave("ggtay.png", scale = 1.5, dpi = 300) 		# to save plot
  ```

 <p align="center"> <img src="images/ggtay.png" alt="Img" width="400px" /></p>

To visualise __all the bands together__, `facet_wrap` can be used in gplot. First,
create a stack of all the bands.

```{r}
t <-stack(b1,b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, b8, b9, b10, b11, b12)

gplot(t) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value))+
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  coord_quickmap()+
  ggtitle("Sentinel 2 Loch tay, raster plots") +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=20),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggsave("allbands.png", scale = 1.5, dpi = 300) # to save plot
```

<p align="center"> <img src="images/allbands.png" alt="Img" width="700px" /></p>

Alternatively, for a quick visualisation, the original file can be loaded as a
__raster brick__ and plotted using 'plot'.

```{r}
s_tay <- brick('data/taycrop.tif')
plot(s_tay)
```

<p align="center"> <img src="images/allbands2.png" alt="Img" width="800px" /></p>

Notice the __difference in colour and range of legend__ between the different bands. Different earth surfaces reflect the solar radiation differently and each raster layer represents how much incident solar radiation is reflected at a __particular wavelength bandwidth__. Bands 6 to 9 are in the __Near Infrared Range (NIR)__. Vegetation reflects more NIR than other wavelengths but water absorbs NIR, therefore the lighter areas with __high reflectance values are likely to be vegetation__ and the dark blue, __low reflectance value areas, likely to be water__. Also note that the Sentinel 2 bands have 3 levels of spatial resolution, 10m, 20m, and 60m (see table below).

| 10m resolution| 20m resolution| 60m resolution |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| band 2, band 3, band 4 and band 8    | band 5, band 6, band 7, band 11 and band 12  | band 1, band 9 and band 10 |

## 3. Raster manipulations: NDVI and KMN classification

The [Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index){:target="_blank"} is a widely used __vegetation index__ that quantifies __vegetation presence, health or structure__. It is calculated using the __Near Infrared (NIR) and Red bandwith of the spectrum__. Healthy vegetation __reflects light strongly in the NIR__ part of the spectrum and __absorbs light in red part of the visible spectrum for photosynthesis__. A high __ratio__ between __light refected in the NIR__ part of the spectrum and __light reflected in the red__ part of the spectrum would represent areas that potentially have healthy vegetation. It is worth noting that __different plant species absorb light in the red part of the spectrum at different rates__. The same plant will also absorb light in the red band differently __depending on whether it is stressed or healthy__, or the __time of year__. It is often used __over large areas__ as an indication of __land cover change__.

The NDVI ratio is calculated using __(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)__. A pixel with an NDVI of __less than 0.2__ is __not likely to be dominated by vegetation__, and an NDVI of __0.6 and above__ is likely to be __dense vegetation__. In R, we can calculate the NDVI by creating a function and using raster math operations where __NIR = band 8__ and __Red = band 4__ in Sentinel 2 images. We will first use the raster brick created earlier from the original file.

```{r}
# NDVI

VI <- function(img, k, i) {
  bk <- img[[k]]
  bi <- img[[i]]
  vi <- (bk - bi) / (bk + bi)
  return(vi)
}

# For sentinel 2,  NIR = 8, red = 4

ndvi <- VI(s_tay, 8, 4)
png('ndviplot.png', width = 4, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)
plot(ndvi, col = rev(terrain.colors(10)), main = 'Sentinel 2, Loch Tay-NDVI')
dev.off()
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/NDVI.png" alt="Img" width="500px" /></p>

To find out the distribution of the pixel NDVI values, we can plot a histogram.

```{r}
# view histogram of NDVI data

png('ndvihist.png', width = 4, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)
hist(ndvi,
     main = "Distribution of NDVI values",
     xlab = "NDVI",
     ylab= "Frequency",
     col = "aquamarine3",
     xlim = c(-0.5, 1),
     breaks = 30,
     xaxt = 'n')
axis(side=1, at = seq(-0.5,1, 0.05), labels = seq(-0.5,1, 0.05))
dev.off()
```


<p align="center"> <img src="images/ndvihist.png" alt="Img" width="500px" /></p>

The histogram is strongly skewed to the right, towards highh NDVI values, indicating a __highly vegetated area_.

You can also __mask the pixels__ with an NDVI value of less than 0.4 (less likely to be vegetation) to __highlight the vegetated areas__.

```{r}
# mask cells that have NDVI of less than 0.4 (less likely to be vegetation)

png('ndvimask.png', width = 4, height = 4, units = "in", res = 300)
veg <- reclassify(ndvi, cbind(-Inf, 0.4, NA))
plot(veg, main = 'Veg cover')
dev.off()
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/ndvimask.png" alt="Img" width="600px" /></p>

We still have a high vegetation cover, which is to be expected in this part of Scotland.
You might want to __export the NDVI raster__ you have created to use in QGIS or other software.
To do this, use the `writeraster` function. Saving the data as integers rather than floats, requires less memory and processing for the computer to handle. A float is a term used to describe a variable with a fractional value or decimals.

```{r}
writeRaster(x = ndvi,
            filename="yourepo/sentinel2/tay_ndvi_2018.tif", 	# where your file will go
            format = "GTiff", 					# save as a tif
            datatype='INT2S', 					# save as a INTEGER rather than a float
            #overwrite = TRUE)  				# OPTIONAL - be careful. This will OVERWRITE previous files
```
Raster operations also allow us to perform __unsupervised classification__ or __clustering of the pixels__ in the satellite image.
In this context, unsupervised means that we are __not using training data__ for the clustering.
This type of classification can be __useful when not a lot is known about an area__. In the example below, we are going to use the kmeans
algorithm. The __algorithm groups pixels that have similar spectral properties in the same cluster__. We are going to create __10 clusters__ using the NDVI raster we have just created above, but first, we need to convert the raster into a matrix or array.

```{r}

# convert the raster to vector/matrix ('getValues' converts the RasterLAyer to array) )

nr <-getValues(ndvi)
str(nr)

# important to set the seed generator because `kmeans` initiates the centres in random locations

set.seed(99)

# create 10 clusters, allow 500 iterations, start with 5 random sets using 'Lloyd' method

kmncluster <- kmeans(na.omit(nr), centers = 10, iter.max = 500,
                     nstart = 5, algorithm = "Lloyd")

# kmeans returns an object of class 'kmeans'

str(kmncluster)

```

Kmeans returns an object with 9 elements. The length of the cluster element within kmncluster is 429936
which is the same as the length of nr created from the ndvi. The cell values of kmncluster$cluster __range between 1 to 10__
__corresponding to the input number of clusters we provided__ in the kmeans function. kmncluster$cluster indicates
the cluster label for corresponding pixel.
We need to __convert the kmncluster$cluster array back to a RasterLayer of the same dimension as the ndvi__.

```{r}

# First create a copy of the ndvi layer
knr <- ndvi

# Now replace raster cell values with kmncluster$cluster
# array
knr[] <- kmncluster$cluster

# Alternative
values(knr) <- kmncluster$cluster
knr
```

We can see that knr is a RasterLayer with 429,936 cells, but we do not know which cluster (1-10) belongs what land cover or vegetation type. One way of attributing a class to a land cover type is by __plotting the cluster side-by-side with a reference layer of land cover__ and using unique colour for each cluster. As we don't have one for our example area, we can use the NDVI map we created earlier or the RGB plot.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(ndvi, col = rev(terrain.colors(10)), main = "NDVI")
plot(knr, main = "Kmeans", col = viridis_pal(option="D")(10))
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/knr_ndvi.png" alt="Img" width="700px" /></p>

```{r}
png('rgb_kmeans.png', width = 10, height = 8, units = "in", res = 300)
par(mar=c(10.8,5,10.8,2), mfrow = c(1, 2))
plotRGB(tayRGB, axes = TRUE, stretch = "lin", main = "RGB")
plot(knr, main = "Kmeans", yaxt='n', col = viridis_pal(option="D")(10))
dev.off()
```
<p align="center"> <img src="images/rgb_kmeans.png" alt="Img" width="700px" /></p>

A simple classification like this one is only to give an idea of land cover types.
In the above example, we could deduce that cluster 8, in green, is water as it covers the Loch.
We can also spot patterns in the vegetation cover in both the NDVI and kmeans cluster plots.
We could deduce that the areas with the highest NDVI ratio are likely to be forest cover.
The raster could be exported to QGIS, as shown above, and with land cover class information or a reference raster,
classes could be assigned to each cluster.

### Exercise: Using the NDVI, RGB and kmeans plot, can you deduce other land cover around the Loch Tay area?
