In our first tutorial we will be using a publicly available dataset which includes occurrence records for species in a range of taxa - the data were collected by different NGOs and environmental agencies - we downloaded the records for 2000-2016 (from the NBN Gateway https://data.nbn.org.uk/), which you can get from this <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-1-RBasics" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. We will use R, and in particular RStudio. R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)" target="_blank">programming language</a> developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is based on the programming language S, which itself was created by John Chambers (so next time you need a fun R fact, you can start with "Did you know that before R, there was S?"). R is increasingly gaining popularity in research across many fields, including ecology and environmental sciences. <b>R is free to use and code can be easily shared among collaborators.</b> Furthermore, R has a wonderful community supporting its development - many people are creating open source packages for R, which include lots of useful functions which make our analysis easier. R comes with a set of base functions, like `sum()`, which would sum up whatever is in the brackets, but by installing and using additional packages, there are many more functions we could use.

<a name="download"></a>

### 1. Download R and RStudio

You can download R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)</a> - select the link appropriate for your operating system. You can use the base R GUI (Graphic User Interface), or also download RStudio from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank">the RStudio website</a> (select the free open source desktop version). Our team uses RStudio and as such, in our tutorials you will see screenshots from RStudio. The interface you use is very much a personal choice dependent on what makes sense for your workflow - we find RStudio more intuitive and easy to use. If you are using a Mac, in addition to R and RStudio, you need to download XQuartz (<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank">available here</a>).

<b>All of the files necessary to complete this tutorial are available to download from this <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-1-RBasics" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. Click on Download Zip and unzip the files - later on we will learn more about using Github. If you get stuck or feel unsure about something - you can read the <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-1-RBasics/blob/master/CC_1_RBasics_Full_Script2.R" target="_blank">full script on Github</a>, or get in touch with us - we are more than happy to answer questions at ourcodingclub@gmail.com !</b>

Open RStudio. Click on <i>File/New File/R script</i>. You will now see a window like the one above. You can type code directly into the console - pressing enter at the end of the line runs the code. You can also write your code in a script (e.g. in the new script file you just created) - to run a line of code from your script, press <i>Ctrl+Enter</i> on Windows and <i>Cmd+Enter</i> on a Mac. <b>Saving your code in a script file means that you are keeping a record of your work - you don't need to remember what you did or re-write the code later. When writing a script, it's useful to add comments (plain text) (inserting # in front of a line of text tells R it's a comment) describing your analysis.</b> Begin your script by adding some comments on who is writing the script, the date, as well as the main goal - in our case, determining how many species from different taxa have been recorded in Edinburgh. Here's an example:

```r
# Coding Club Workshop 1 R Basics
# Learning how to import and explore data, and make graphs through investigating Edinburgh's biodiversity
# Written by Gergana Daskalova 6/11/16 University of Edinburgh
```

The next lines of code usually describe the packages you are using. To install a package, you need to type in `install.packages("package-name")`. You only need to install packages once, afterwards you just need to load them using `library(package-name)`. Here we will be using the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html" target="_blank"><i>dplyr</i> developped by Hadley Wickham</a>. We will use <i>dplyr</i> a lot in the future - this package is excellent at formatting and manipulating data. <b>When working in R, you have a working directory (a certain folder on your computer) - that's where anything you save, such as plots will go. To find out where your working directory is now, run the code `getwd()`. If you want to change it, you can use `setwd()`:</b>

```r
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
# Note that there are quotation marks when installing a package, but not when loading it

setwd(C:\User\R_Dreams)
# This is an example file path, change to an existing folder on your computer
```

<a name="import"></a>

### 2. Import and check data

<center><img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc93/_avocet/_avocet134/Import.png" alt="Img" style="width: 960px;"/></center>

In RStudio you can either click on <i>Import dataset</i> and navigate to where you have saved your file, or use the `read.csv()` command. A window will pop up previewing your data, make sure that next to <i>Heading</i> you've selected <i>Yes</i> (this tells R to treat the first row of your data as the column titles) and click <i>Import</i>. If you click on <i>Import dataset</i>, afterwards in the console you will see the code for your import, which includes the file path - it's a good idea to copy that code into your script, so that for future reference, you know from where you imported your dataset and which dataset you used. R works best with csv (comma separated values) files - if you entered your data in Excel, you would need to click on <i>Save as</i> and select csv as the file extension. A message will come up, click ok. When entering data in excel, don't put any spaces in your row names, as they will confuse R later.

```r
edidiv <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/Desktop/Coding Club Endeavours/edidiv.csv")
# This is the file path based on where I saved the data, you would replace that with your own
```

<b>R is an object-based language - this means that the data you import, the values you might create later, they are all stored in objects that you name. The arrow <- is how you assign objects - here we assigned our data file to the object `edidiv`. You can also see `edidiv` in your global environment - if you click on it, the data opens up in a separate tab for you to view.</b>

A really important step is to check that your data imported alright - it's good practice to always run this code - do you see any missing values, do the numbers/names make sense? If you go straight into analysis, you risk later finding out that R didn't read your data correctly and having to re-do it, or worse, analysing wrong data without noticing.

```r
head(edidiv)                # Displays the first few rows
tail(edidiv)                # Displays the last rows
str(edidiv)                 # Tells you whether the variables are continuous or categorical
dim(edidiv)                 # Displays number of rows and columns
summary(edidiv)             # Gives you a summary of the data
summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)  # By using the dollar sign, you refer to a particular variable from your dataset
```

<a name="richness"></a>

### 3. Calculate species richness

<b>We have records of species from a few different taxa collected by NGOs and government agencies in Edinburgh from 2000 to 2016. Since we want to explore Edinburgh's biodiversity, we can create a graph showing how many species from each taxa have been recorded here. We need to create a vector (a series of values), each representing the number of species in each taxon, e.g. how many birds have been recorded in Edinburgh. We will create an object, containing the data for each taxon, and then count the number of different species within it.</b> You can calculate species richness in Excel, but that has several disadvantages, especially when working with large datasets like ours - you have no record of what you clicked on, how you sorted the data and what you copied/deleted - accidental mistakes can slip by without you noticing. In R, on the other hand, you have your script, so you can go back and check all the steps in your analysis.

```r
Beetle <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Beetle")
Bird <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Bird")
# You can create the objects for the remaining taxa, if you need to remind yourself of the names, check summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)

# To find out the number of different species in each taxa, we will use the function unique() to single out different species and the function (length) to count them
a <- length(unique(Beetle$taxonName))
b <- length(unique(Bird$taxonName))
# You can choose whatever names you want for your objects, here I used a,b,c,d... for the sake of brevity, but in general you should aim to have more informative names, e.g. `beetle_sp`.
```

<a name="vector"></a>

### 4. Create a vector and plot it

You're probably noticing a pattern in the code above - and a lot of copy and pasting! That's not particularly efficient - in future tutorials we will learn how to use more of <i>dplyr</i>'s functions and achieve the same result with way less code! Now we can combine all those values in a vector, which is done using the `c()` function (c stands for concatenate), and add labels with `names()`.

```r
biodiv <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
names(biodiv) <- c("Beetle",
                   "Bird",
                   "Butterfly",
                   "Dragonfly",
                   "Fl.Plants",
                   "Fungus",
                   "Hymenopteran",
                   "Lichen",
                   "Liverwort",
                   "Mammal",
                   "Mollusc")
```

There are spaces in front of and behind `<-`, after commas and around `==`, those are added to make it easier to read the code. Additionally, all the labels have been indented on a new line - otherwise the line of code gets very long and you have to keep scrolling left and right to see your code. Also, take care to check that you are matching your vector values and labels correctly - you wouldn't want to label the number of beetles as lichen species! This would have been way easier to check if the objects were called e.g. `beetle_sp`, not `a` - the good thing about keeping a script is that I can go back and check that I have indeed assigned the number of beetle species to `a`.

<b>We can now visualise species richness with the `barplot()` function.</b> You will see the plot appear at the bottom right corner of RStudio. There's a few things not quite right that we should fix - there are no axis titles, not all column labels are visible, and the value for plant species (n=521) exceeds the highest value on the y axis, so we need to extend it. The great thing about R is that you don't need to think of the code to fix that all on your own - you can use the `help()` function and see what code you need to add in. Look through the help output, what code do you need to add in?

```r
barplot(biodiv)
help(barplot)     # For help with the barplot() function
help(par)         # For help with plotting in general
```

We also want to save our plot - you can click on <i>Export</i> - if you don't change the Directory, the file will be saved in your working directory. You can adjust the dimensions to get the bar chart to look how you like it, and you should also add in a meaningful file name - Rplot01 won't be of much help if you are trying to find the file later. You can also save your file using the `png()` function.

barplot(biodiv, xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600), cex.names= 1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
dev.off()

### 5. Create a data frame and plot it

This was a vector of values, each with a label, which is suitable when dealing with just one set of values. However, often you will have more than one variable and they might be different types of variables - e.g. some continuous, some categorical. In those cases, we will use data frames - <b>data frames represent tables of values, so a two-dimensional structure with rows and columns. Another possible data format is a matrix - a matrix can have several rows of data as well (e.g. you can combine vectors into a matrix), but the variables are all of the same type, for instance they are all numerical, and of the same length - e.g. 15 rows in each column.</b>

We will now create a data frame with our species richness data and then save it as a csv file, so that should we need it later, we can use the csv file straight away. We will use the `data.frame()` function, but first we will create an object that contains the names of all the taxa and another object with all the values for the species richness of each taxon.

```r
# Creating an object called "taxa" that contains all the taxa names
taxa <- c("Beetle",
          "Bird",
          "Butterfly",
          "Dragonfly",
          "Fl.Plants",
          "Fungus",
          "Hymenopteran",
          "Lichen",
          "Liverwort",
          "Mammal",
          "Mollusc")
# Turning this object into a factor, i.e. a categorical variable
taxa_f <- factor(taxa)
# Combining all the values for number of species in an object called richness
richness <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
biodata <- data.frame(taxa_f, richness)
write.csv(biodata, file="biodata.csv")
# The csv file will be saved in your working directory
```

If we want to create and save a barplot using the data frame, we need to slightly change the code - because data frames can contain multiple variables, we need to tell R exactly which one we want it to plot - remember how before we used the dollar sign for that, we will do it again.

```r
png("barplot2.png", width=1600, height=600)
barplot(biodata$richness, names.arg=c("Beetle",
                                      "Bird",
                                      "Butterfly",
                                      "Dragonfly",
                                      "Fl.Plants",
                                      "Fungus",
                                      "Hymenopteran",
                                      "Lichen",
                                      "Liverwort",
                                      "Mammal",
                                      "Mollusc"),
        xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600))
dev.off()
```
