In our first tutorial we will learn how to use R and RStudio to import and explore data, as well as make figures. Since Coding Club is based at the University of Edinburgh, we thought we would start by exploring the biodiversity around our home city. We will be using a publicly available dataset which includes occurence records for species in a range of taxa - the data were collected by different NGOs and environmental agencies - we downloaded the records for 2000-2016 (from the NBN Gateway https://data.nbn.org.uk/).

In Coding Club, we will be using R, and in particular RStudio. R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)">programming language</a> developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is based on the programming language S, which itself was created by John Chambers (so next time you need a fun R fact, you can start with Did you know that before R, there was S?"). R is increasingly gaining popularity in research in many fields, including ecology and environmental sciences. R is free to use and code can be easily shared among collaborators - what we particularly like about it is that it's a great way to keep track of your statistical analysis - if you need to go back to a project from a couple of years ago, you can simply read your programming script and see what you did! Furthermore, R has a wonderful community supporting its development - many people are creating packages for R, which include lots of useful functions which make our analysis easier. R comes with a set of base functions, like sum(), which would sum up whatever is in the brackets, but by installing and using additional packages, there are many more functions we could use.

You can download R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)</a> - select the link appropriate for your operating system. You can use the base R GUI (Graphic User Interface), or also download RStudio from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/">the RStudio website</a> (select the free open source desktop version). Our team uses RStudio and as such, in our tutorials you will see screenshots from RStudio. The interface you use is very much a personal choise dependant on what makes sense for your workflow - we find RStudio more intuitive and easy to use, but fully acknowledge that this is a matter of personal preference. If you are using a Mac, in addition to R and RStudio, you would need to download ZQuartz (<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">available here</a>)

All of the files necessary to complete this tutorial are available to download from this <a href="">Github repository</a>.
First, download the dataset (biodiv.csv) and open RStudio. Click on File/New File/R script. You will now see a window like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/RStudio.png" alt="Img", style="width: 960px;"/>

You can type code directly into the console - pressing enter at the end of the line runs the code. We would advise you to write your code in a script (e.g. in the new script file you just created) - to run a line of code from your script you press Ctrl+R or Ctrl+Enter on Windows and Cmd+R on a Mac. Saving your code in a script file means that you are keeping a record of your work - you don't need to remember what you did or re-do it if you come back to it later - you just open your saved script file and continue your work. When writing a script, it's especially useful to add comments (inserting # in front of a line of text tells R it's a comment) describing what analysis you are doing, why you are doing it, as well as the different steps you are taking to get your results.

We can now start our analysis - when completing this tutorial, it might be more convenient for you to open the instructions on half of your screen and RStudio on the other half.

First, add in some comments on who is writing the script, the date, as well as the main goal - in our case, determining how many species from different taxa have been recorded in Edinburgh. Here's an example:

```{r}
# Coding Club Workshop 1 R Basics
# Learning how to import and explore data, and make graphs through investigating Edinburgh's biodiversity
# Written by Gergana Daskalova 6/11/16 University of Edinburgh
```

The next lines of code usually describe the packages we are using in this analysis - it's convenient to keep them together at the top. To install a package, you need to type in install.packages("package-name"). You only need to install packages once, afterwards you just need to load them using library(package-name). Here we will be using the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html">dplyr developped by Hadley Wickham</a>. We will use dplyr a lot in the future - this package is excellent at formatting and manipulating data.

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

when working in R, you have a working directory (a certain folder on your computer) - that's where anything you save, such as plots will go. To find out where your working directory is now, run the code getwd(). If you want to change it, you can use setwd(), with your file path, e.g. C:\User\R_Dreams in the brackets.

Now we can import our data - in RStudio you can either click on the "Import dataset" button and navigate to where you have saved your file, or use the read.csv() function. A window will pop up previewing your data, make sure that next to Heading you've selected Yes (this tells R to treat the first row of your data as the column titles) and click Import. If you click on "Import dataset", afterwards in the console you will see the code for your import, which includes the file path - it's a good idea to copy that code into your script, so that for future reference, you know from where you imported your dataset and which dataset exactly you imported. R works with csv (comma separated values) files - if you entered your data in Excel, you would need to click on Save as and select csv as the file extension. A message will come up, click ok. When entering data in excel, don't put any spaces in your row names, as they will confuse R later.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/Import.png" alt="Img", style="width: 960px;"/>

```{r}
edidiv <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/Desktop/Coding Club Endeavours/edidiv.csv")
# This is the file path based on where I saved the data, you would replace that with your own
```

R is an object-based language - this means that the data you import, the values you might create later, they are all stored in objects that you name. The arrow <- is how you assign objects - here we assigned our data file to the object edidiv. You can also see edidiv in your global environment now - if you click on it, the data opens up in a separate tab for you to view.

A really important step is to check that your data imported alright - it's good practice to always run this code to make sure your data is fully imported the way you want it:

```{r}
head(edidiv)                # Displays the first few rows
tail(edidiv)                # Displays the last rows
str(edidiv)                 # Tells you whether the variables are continuous or categorical
summary(edidiv)             # Gives you a summary of the data
summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)  # Gives you a summary of just the taxonGroup variable - by using the dollar sign, you can refer to a particular variable from your dataset
```

Take some time to look at the summary outputs - what does our data represent? We have records of species recorded from a few different taxa by NGOs and government agencies in Edinburgh from 2000 to 2016. Since we want to explore Edinburgh's biodiversity, we can create a graph showing how many species from each taxa have been recorded here. We need to create a vector (a series of values), each representing the number of species in each taxa, e.g. how many birds have been recorded in Edinburgh. We will create an object, containing the data for each taxa, and then count the number of different species within it.

```{r}
Beetle <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Beetle")
Bird <- filter(edidiv, taxonGroup == "Bird")
# You can create the objects for the other taxa, if you need to remind yourself of the names, check summary(edidiv$taxonGroup)

# To find out the number of different species in each taxa, we will use the function unique() to single out different species and the function (length) to count them
a <- length(unique(Beetle$taxonName))
b <- length(unique(Bird$taxonName))
# You can choose whatever names you want for your objects, here I used a,b,c,d... for the sake of brevity, but in general you should aim to have more informative names, e.g. beetle_sp.
```

Now we can combine all those values in a vector, which is done using the c() function.

```{r}
# We can now combine all those object in one vector and add labels using the names() function
biodiv <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
names(biodiv) <- c("Beetle",
                   "Bird",
                   "Butterfly",
                   "Dragonfly",
                   "Fl.Plants",
                   "Fungus",
                   "Hymenopteran",
                   "Lichen",
                   "Liverwort",
                   "Mammal",
                   "Mollusc")
```

You might have noticed that there are spaces in front of and behing <-, after commas and around ==, those are added to make it easier to read the code. Additionally, all the labels have been indented on a new line - otherwise the line of code gets very long and it's rather inconvenient to have to keep scrowing left and right to see your code. Also, take care to check that you are matching your vector values and labels correctly - you wouldn't want to label the number of beetles as lichen species! This would have been way easier to check if the objects were called e.g. beetle_sp, not a - the good thing about keeping a record of your script though is that I can go back and check that I have indeed assigned the number of beetle species to a.

We have all the values now, so we can visualise them quickly with the barplot() function. You will see the plot appear at the bottom right corner of RStudio. There's a few things not quite right that we should fix - there are no axis titles, not all column labels are visible, and the value for plant species (n=521) exceeds the highest value on the y axis, so we need to extend it. The great thing about R is that you don't need to think of the code to fix that all on your own - you can use the help() function and see what code you need to add in. Look through the help output, what code do you need to add in?

```{r}
barplot(biodiv)
help(barplot)     # For help with the barplot() function
help(par)         # For help with plotting in general
```

We also want to save our plot - you can click on "Export" - if you don't change the Directory, the file will be saved in your working directory. You can adjust the dimensions to get the bar chart to look how you like it, and you should also add in a meaningful file name - Rplot01 won't be of much help if you are trying to find the file later. You can also save your file using the png() function, where you need to specify a file name as well as its dimensions.

```{r}
png("barplot.png", width=1600, height=600)
barplot(biodiv, xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600), cex.names= 1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.lab=1.5)
dev.off()
# The cex code increases the font size
# The plot has been saved in your working directory
# To confirm where that was, you can use getwd(), and to change it, you can use setwd()
```

This was a vector of values, each with a label, which is suitable when dealing with just one set of values. However, most often you will have more than one variable and they might be different types of variables - e.g. some continuous, some categorical. In those cases, we will use data frames - data frames represent tables of values, so a two-dimensional structure with rows and columns. Another possible data format is a matrix - a matrix can have several rows of data as well (e.g. you can combine vectors into a matrix), but the variables are all of the same type, for instance they are all numerical, and of the same length - e.g. 15 rows in each column.

We will now create a data frame with our species richness data and then save it as a csv file, so that should we need it later, we can use the csv file straight away. We will use the data.frame() function, but first we will create an object that contains the names for all the taxa and another object with all the values for the species richness of each taxa. For that, we will use the c() function you are already familiar with.

```{r}
# Creating an object called "taxa" that contains all the taxa names
taxa <- c("Beetle",
          "Bird",
          "Butterfly",
          "Dragonfly",
          "Fl.Plants",
          "Fungus",
          "Hymenopteran",
          "Lichen",
          "Liverwort",
          "Mammal",
          "Mollusc")
# Turning this object into a factor, i.e. a categorical variable
taxa_f <- factor(taxa)
# Combining all the values for number of species in an object called richness
richness <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k)
biodata <- data.frame(taxa_f, richness)
write.csv(biodata, file="biodata.csv")
# The csv file will be saved in your working directory
```

If we want to create and save a barplot using the data frame, not the vector, we need to slightly change the code - because data frames can contain multiple variables, we need to tell R exactly which one we want it to plot - remember how before we used the dollar sign for that, we will do it again.

```{r}
png("barplot2.png", width=1600, height=600)
barplot(biodata$richness, names.arg=c("Beetle",
                                      "Bird",
                                      "Butterfly",
                                      "Dragonfly",
                                      "Fl.Plants",
                                      "Fungus",
                                      "Hymenopteran",
                                      "Lichen",
                                      "Liverwort",
                                      "Mammal",
                                      "Mollusc"),
        xlab="Taxa", ylab="Number of species", ylim=c(0,600))
dev.off()

In this tutorial we found out how many species from a range of taxa have been recorded in Edinburgh - we hope you enjoyed your introduction to R and RStudio - the best is yet to come!
