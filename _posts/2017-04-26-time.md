Make a new script file using `File/ New File/ R Script` and we are all set to explore how biodiversity has changed based on the LPI data.

```r
setwd("PATH_TO_FOLDER")
```

Next, install (`install.packages("")`) and load (`library()`) the packages needed for this tutorial.

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("scales")

library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
```

Finally, load the `.RData` files we will be using for the tutorial.

```r
load("")
```

## 1. Formatting time series data 

The most common issue when using time series data in R is getting it into a format that is easily readable by R and any packages you are using. A sensible format for recording time series data to be readable by most programs and languages puts the largest chunk of time first (e.g. year), and gets progressively smaller, like this:

```
2017-02-25 18:30:45
```

This can be generalised to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. If you can record your data in this format to begin with, analysis will be much easier. Obviously if time isn't important for your measurements, you can drop the `HH:MM:SS` bit from your records.

The data in __ is currently interpreted by R as being from the `character` class. But R also has a `Date` class, which is much easier to work with, so we can coerce the data to the `Date` class:

```r
# Check the class of milk$Month
class(milk$Month)

# Coerce to `Date` class
milk$Month_dateÂ§ <- as.Date(milk$Month, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Check it worked
class(milk$Month_date) 
```

Data in the `Date` class in the conventional `YYYY-MM-DD` format are easier to use in `ggplot2` and various time series analysis packages. `format =` lets `as.Date` know what form the original data is in. The symbols `%Y`, `%m`, `%d` etc. are codes understood by many programming languages to define date types. Here is an expanded table of date codes:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}
</style>
<table class="tg">

    <th class="tg-4w4l">Name</th>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">Code</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Long year</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%Y</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">2017</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Short year</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%y</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">17</td>
  </tr> 
 <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Numeric month</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%m</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">02</td>

  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Abbreviated month</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%b</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Feb</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Full month</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%B</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">February</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Day</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%d</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Abbreviated weekday</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%a</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Sat</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Full weekday</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%A</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Saturday</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Day of the week (1-7)</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%u</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">Day of the year</td>
    <td class="tg-4w4l">%j</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">56</td>
  </tr>

To transform a date format into a character format with an alternative layout you can use `format()` in conjunction with any of the date codes in the table above. But note that this new character format won't be interpreted as a date by R:

```r
format(milk$Month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")
class(format(milk$Month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")  # class is no longer `Date`
```

## 3. Plotting time series data 

Plotting time series data with ggplot requires the use of `scale_x_date` to correctly build axis labels and allow easy customisation of axis ticks:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = Month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

Play around with `date_labels`, replacing `"%Y"` with some other date marks from <a href="#date_marks">the table above</a> (i.e. `%m-%Y`). `date_breaks` can also be customised to change the axis label frequency, other options include `month`, `week` and `day`.

## 4. Statistical analysis of time series data 

#### Decomposition
Time series data can contain multiple patterns at different scales. The process of isolating each of these patterns is known as decomposition. Have a look at a simple plot of `milk` like the one we saw earlier:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = Month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

Firstly, it looks like there is a general upward trend, more milk is being produced in 1975 than in 1962. This is known as a "__smooth__" pattern, one that increases or decreases regularly over the course of the time series. We can see this pattern more clearly by plotting a loess regression through the data:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = Month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, span = 0.6)
```

`span` sets the number of points used to plot each local regression in the curve, the smaller the number the more points are used and the more closely the curve will fit the original data.

Next, it looks like there are some peaks and troughs that occur regularly in each year. This is a "__seasonal__" pattern. We can investigate this pattern more by plotting each year as it's own line and comparing:

```r
# Extract month and year and store in new column
milk$year <- format(milk$Month_date, format = "%Y")
milk$month_num <- format(milk$Month_date, format = "%m")

ggplot(milk, aes(x = month_num, y = milk_prod, group = year)) + 
	geom_line(aes(colour = year))
```

"__Cyclic__" trends are similar to seasonal trends in that they recur over time, but occur over longer time scales. It may be that the general upward trend and plateau seen with the loess regression may be part of a longer decadal cycle, but this is impossible to test without a longer time series.

#### Forecasting

Often, time series data are used to predict what might happen in the future, given the patterns seen in the data. This is known as forecasting. There are many methods used to forecast time series data, and they vary widely in complexity, but this should serve as a brief introduction to the most commonly used methods.
