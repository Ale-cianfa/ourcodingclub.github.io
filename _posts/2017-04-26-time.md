Make a new script file using `File/ New File/ R Script` and we are all set to explore how biodiversity has changed based on the LPI data.

```r
setwd("PATH_TO_FOLDER")
```

Next, install (`install.packages("")`) and load (`library()`) the packages needed for this tutorial.

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("scales")
install.packages("forecast")

library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(forecast)
```

Finally, load the `.csv` files we will be using for the tutorial.

```r
milk <- read.csv("monthly_milk.csv")  # Milk production per cow per month
daily_milk <- read.csv("daily_milk.csv")  # Milk production per cow per milking
```

## 1. Formatting time series data 

The most common issue when using time series data in R is getting it into a format that is easily readable by R and any packages you are using. A sensible format for recording time series data to be readable by most programs and languages puts the largest chunk of time first (e.g. year), and gets progressively smaller, like this:

```
2017-02-25 18:30:45
```

This can be generalised to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. If you can record your data in this format to begin with, analysis will be much easier. Obviously if time isn't important for your measurements, you can drop the `HH:MM:SS` bit from your records.

The data in __ shows the monthly milk production by a herd of cattle between 1962 and 1975. First, check the form of the data set:

```r
head(milk)

class(milk)

class(milk$month)
```

`head(milk)` shows us that the `Month` column is in a sensible format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and contains no time data. However, `class(milk$Month)` shows us that the data is currently interpreted by R as being from the `character` class. But R also has a `Date` class, which is much easier to work with, so we can coerce the data to the `Date` class:

```r
# Coerce to `Date` class
milk$month_date <- as.Date(milk$month, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Check it worked
class(milk$month_date) 
```

Data in the `Date` class in the conventional `YYYY-MM-DD` format are easier to use in `ggplot2` and various time series analysis packages. `format =` lets `as.Date` know what form the original data is in. The symbols `%Y`, `%m`, `%d` etc. are codes understood by many programming languages to define date types. Here is an expanded table of date codes:

To transform a date format into a character format with an alternative layout you can use `format()` in conjunction with any of the date codes in the table above. But note that this new character format won't be interpreted as a date by R. Try a few different combinations of date codes using the code below as an example:

```r
format(milk$month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")
class(format(milk$month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")  # class is no longer `Date`
```

#### Dates and times 

Sometimes, both the date and time of observation are important. The best way to format time information is to append it after the date in the same column like this:

```
2017-02-25 18:30:45
```

The most appropriate and useable class for this data is the `POSIXct POSIXt` double. Let's look at another milk production dataset, this time with higher resolution, showing morning and evening milking times over the course of a few months:

```r
head(daily_milk)

class(daily_milk$date_time)
```

Again, the date and time are in a sensible format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), but are interpreted by R as being from the `character` class. Lets change this to `POSIXct POSIXt` using `as.POSIXct()`:

```r
daily_milk$date_time_posix <- as.POSIXct(daily_milk$date_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

class(daily_milk$date_time_posix)
```

Below is an expanded table of time codes:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}

<table class="tg">

    <th class="tg-4w4l">Name</th>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">Code</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">Example</th>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">Hour (24 hour)</th>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">%H</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">18</th>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">Hour (12 hour)</th>
    <th class="tg-4w4l">%I</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l">06</th>

#### Correcting badly formatted date data

If you are presented with a badly formatted set of date data, it's easy to transform it back into a useable format using `format()`. First, let's create some badly formatted date data to look similar to this `01/Dec/1975-1`, the day of the month, abbreviated month, year, and day of the week:

```r
bad_date <- format(milk$month_date, format = "%d/%b/%Y-%u")
head(bad_date)
class(bad_date)
```

Then to transform it back to the useful `YYYY-MM-DD` just use `as.Date`, specifying the format that badly formatted data is in:

```r
good_date <- as.Date(milk$bad_date, format = "%d/%b/%Y-%u")
head(good_date)
class(good_date)
```

## 3. Plotting time series data 

Plotting time series data with ggplot requires the use of `scale_x_date()` to correctly build axis labels and allow easy customisation of axis ticks:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

Play around with `date_labels`, replacing `"%Y"` with some other date marks from <a href="#date_marks">the table above</a> (i.e. `%m-%Y`). `date_breaks` can also be customised to change the axis label frequency, other options include `month`, `week` and `day`.

Plotting date and time data is done similarly, using `scale_x_datetime()`:

```r
ggplot(daily_milk, aes(x = date_time_posix, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%p-%d", date_breaks = "36 hour")
```

## 4. Statistical analysis of time series data 

#### Decomposition
Time series data can contain multiple patterns at different scales. The process of isolating each of these patterns is known as decomposition. Have a look at a simple plot of `milk` like the one we saw earlier:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

Firstly, it looks like there is a general upward trend, more milk is being produced in 1975 than in 1962. This is known as a "__smooth__" pattern, one that increases or decreases regularly over the course of the time series. We can see this pattern more clearly by plotting a loess regression through the data:

```r
ggplot(milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod)) + 
	geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, span = 0.6)
```

`span` sets the number of points used to plot each local regression in the curve, the smaller the number the more points are used and the more closely the curve will fit the original data.

Next, it looks like there are some peaks and troughs that occur regularly in each year. This is a "__seasonal__" pattern. We can investigate this pattern more by plotting each year as it's own line and comparing:

```r
# Extract month and year and store in new column
milk$year <- format(milk$month_date, format = "%Y")
milk$month_num <- format(milk$month_date, format = "%m")

ggplot(milk, aes(x = month_num, y = milk_prod, group = year)) + 
	geom_line(aes(colour = year))
```

"__Cyclic__" trends are similar to seasonal trends in that they recur over time, but occur over longer time scales. It may be that the general upward trend and plateau seen with the loess regression may be part of a longer decadal cycle, but this is impossible to test without a longer time series.

An alternative method for generating these plots in `ggplot2` is to convert the time series data frame to a `ts` class object and decompose it using `stl()` from the `stats` package. This reduces the ability to customise the plots, but is arguably quicker:

```r
# Transform to `ts` class
milk_ts <- ts(milk$milk_prod, start = 1962, end = 1975, freq = 12)  # Specify start and end year, measurement frequency (monthly = 12)

# Decompose using `stl()`
milk_stl <- stl(milk_ts, s.window = "period")

# Generate plots
plot(milk_stl)  # top=original data, second=estimated seasonal, third=estimated smooth, bottom=estimated irregular
monthplot(milk_ts)
seasonplot(milk_ts)	
```

#### Forecasting

Often, time series data are used to predict what might happen in the future, given the patterns seen in the data. This is known as forecasting. There are many methods used to forecast time series data, and they vary widely in complexity, but this should serve as a brief introduction to the most commonly used methods.
