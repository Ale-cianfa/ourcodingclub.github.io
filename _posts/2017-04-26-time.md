### Tutorial Aims:

#### <a href="#format"> 1. Formatting time series data </a>

#### <a href="#datavis"> 2. Visualising time series data</a>

#### <a href="#stats"> 3. Statistically analysing time series data</a>

#### <a href="#challenge"> 4. Challenge yourself with new data</a>

In this tutorial, we will explore how to explore and analyse time series data in R. Time series analysis is a powerful technique that can be used to understand the various temporal patterns in our data, by decomposing data into different cyclic trends. Time series analysis can also be used to predict how a levels of a variable will change in the future, taking into account what has happened in the past. By completing this tutorial you will learn not only how to do some simple time series analysis, but also how to prepare your data so R understands that is is a date, which is an art in itself.

#### All the resources for this tutorial, including some helpful cheatsheets can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-time-series" target="_blank">this github repository</a>. Clone and download the repo as a zipfile, then unzip it.

Alternatively, you can fork <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-time-series" target="_blank">the repository</a> to your own Github account and then add it as a new RStudio project by copying the HTTPS/SSH link. For more details on how to register on Github, download Git, sync RStudio and Github and use version control, please check out our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html" target="_blank">previous tutorial.</a>

Open R Studio, make a new script file using `File/ New File/ R Script` and we are all set to learn about time series analysis.

First, set your working directory to the folder you just downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-time-series" target="_blank">the github repository</a>, use the code below as a guide, but remember that your filepath will be different:

```r
setwd("~/Downloads/CC-time-series-master")
```

Next, load (`library()`) the packages needed for this tutorial. Remember to `install.packages()` if this is the first time you're using these packages:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(dplyr)
```

Finally, load the `.csv` files we will be using for the tutorial.

```r
monthly_milk <- read.csv("monthly_milk.csv")  # Milk production per cow per month
daily_milk <- read.csv("daily_milk.csv")  # Milk production per cow per milking
```

## 1. Formatting time series data 

The most common issue when using time series data in R is getting it into a format that is easily readable by R and any packages you are using. A sensible format for recording time series data to be readable by most programs and languages puts the largest chunk of time first (e.g. year), and gets progressively smaller, like this:

```
2017-02-25 18:30:45
```

This can be generalised to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. If you can record your data in this format to begin with, analysis will be much easier. Obviously if time isn't important for your measurements, you can drop the `HH:MM:SS` bit from your records.

The data in `monthly_milk` shows the monthly milk production by a herd of cattle between 1962 and 1975. First, check the form of the data set:

```r
head(monthly_milk)

class(monthly_milk)

class(monthly_milk$month)
```

`head(monthly_milk)` shows us that the `Month` column is in a sensible format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and contains no time data. However, `class(monthly_milk$Month)` shows us that the data is currently interpreted by R as being from the `factor` class. But R also has a `Date` class, which is much easier to work with, so we can coerce the data to the `Date` class:

```r
# Coerce to `Date` class
monthly_milk$month_date <- as.Date(monthly_milk$month, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

# Check it worked
class(monthly_milk$month_date) 
```

Data in the `Date` class in the conventional `YYYY-MM-DD` format are easier to use in `ggplot2` and various time series analysis packages. `format =` tells `as.Date` what form the original data is in. The symbols `%Y`, `%m`, `%d` etc. are codes understood by many programming languages to define date types. Note that `as.Date` requires a year, month, and day somewhere in the original data. So if the original data doesn't have one of those, you can add them manually using `paste()`. Here is an expanded table of date codes:

</table>

To transform a `Date` format object into a `character` format with an alternative layout you can use `format()` in conjunction with any of the date codes in the table above. But note that this new character format won't be interpreted as a date by R. Try a few different combinations of date codes using the code below as an example:

```r
format(monthly_milk$month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")
class(format(monthly_milk$month_date, format = "%Y-%B-%u")  # class is no longer `Date`
```

#### Dates and times 

Sometimes, both the date and time of observation are important. The best way to format time information is to append it after the date in the same column like this:

```
2017-02-25 18:30:45
```

The most appropriate and useable class for this data is the `POSIXct POSIXt` double. Let's look at another milk production dataset, this time with higher resolution, showing morning and evening milking times over the course of a few months:

```r
head(daily_milk)

class(daily_milk$date_time)
```

Again, the date and time are in a sensible format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS), but are interpreted by R as being in the `factor` class. Lets change this to `POSIXct POSIXt` using `as.POSIXct()`:

```r
daily_milk$date_time_posix <- as.POSIXct(daily_milk$date_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

class(daily_milk$date_time_posix)
```

Below is an expanded table of time codes:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}

#### Correcting badly formatted date data

If you are presented with a badly formatted set of date data, it's easy to transform it back into a useable format using `format()`. First, let's create some badly formatted date data to look similar to this `01/Dec/1975-1`, the day of the month, abbreviated month, year, and day of the week:

```r
monthly_milk$bad_date <- format(monthly_milk$month_date, format = "%d/%b/%Y-%u")
head(monthly_milk$bad_date)
class(monthly_milk$bad_date)
```

Then to transform it back to the useful `YYYY-MM-DD` just use `as.Date`, specifying the format that badly formatted data is in:

```r
monthly_milk$good_date <- as.Date(monthly_milk$bad_date, format = "%d/%b/%Y-%u")
head(monthly_milk$good_date)
class(monthly_milk$good_date)
```

## 2. Plotting time series data 

Plotting time series data with `ggplot2` requires the use of `scale_x_date()` to correctly build axis labels and allow easy customisation of axis ticks:

```r
ggplot(monthly_milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/monthly_milk_plot.png" alt="Img">
</center>


Play around with `date_labels`, replacing `"%Y"` with some other date marks from <a href="#date_marks">the table above</a> (i.e. `%m-%Y`). `date_breaks` can also be customised to change the axis label frequency, other options include `month`, `week` and `day`.

Plotting date and time data is done similarly, using `scale_x_datetime()`:

```r
ggplot(daily_milk, aes(x = date_time_posix, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%p-%d", date_breaks = "36 hour")
```

<a name="stats"></a>

## 3. Statistical analysis of time series data 

#### Decomposition
Time series data can contain multiple patterns at different scales. The process of isolating each of these patterns is known as decomposition. Have a look at a simple plot of `monthly_milk` like the one we saw earlier:

```r
ggplot(monthly_milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y", date_breaks = "1 year")
```

Firstly, it looks like there is a general upward trend, more milk is being produced in 1975 than in 1962. This is known as a "__smooth__" pattern, one that increases or decreases regularly over the course of the time series. We can see this pattern more clearly by plotting a loess regression through the data:

```r
ggplot(monthly_milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg)) +
	geom_line() +
	geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, span = 0.6)
```

`span` sets the number of points used to plot each local regression in the curve, the smaller the number the more points are used and the more closely the curve will fit the original data.

<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/monthly_milk_loess.png" alt="Img">
</center>


Next, it looks like there are some peaks and troughs that occur regularly in each year. This is a "__seasonal__" pattern. We can investigate this pattern more by plotting each year as it's own line and comparing:

```r
# Extract month and year and store in new column
monthly_milk$year <- format(monthly_milk$month_date, format = "%Y")
monthly_milk$month_num <- format(monthly_milk$month_date, format = "%m")

ggplot(monthly_milk, aes(x = month_num, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg, group = year)) + 
	geom_line(aes(colour = year))
```

<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/monthly_milk_month_trend.png" alt="Img">
</center>

It's clear from the plot that while milk production is steadily getting higher, the same pattern occurs throughout each year, with a peak in May and a trough in November.

"__Cyclic__" trends are similar to seasonal trends in that they recur over time, but occur over longer time scales. It may be that the general upward trend and plateau seen with the loess regression may be part of a longer decadal cycle, but this is impossible to test without a longer time series.

An alternative method to generating these plots in `ggplot2` is to convert the time series data frame to a `ts` class object and decompose it using `stl()` from the `stats` package. This reduces the ability to customise the plots, but is arguably quicker:

```r
# Transform to `ts` class
monthly_milk_ts <- ts(monthly_milk$milk_prod, start = 1962, end = 1975, freq = 12)  # Specify start and end year, measurement frequency (monthly = 12)

# Decompose using `stl()`
monthly_milk_stl <- stl(monthly_milk_ts, s.window = "period")

# Generate plots
plot(monthly_milk_stl)  # top=original data, second=estimated seasonal, third=estimated smooth trend, bottom=estimated irregular element i.e. unaccounted for variation
monthplot(monthly_milk_ts, choice = "seasonal")  # variation in milk production for each month
seasonplot(monthly_milk_ts)	
```

<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/monthly_milk_4plot.png" alt="Img">
</center>


#### Forecasting

Often, time series data are used to predict what might happen in the future, given the patterns seen in the data. This is known as forecasting. There are many methods used to forecast time series data, and they vary widely in complexity, but this should serve as a brief introduction to the most commonly used methods.

All the models we will use today are known as ETS models. ETS stands for Error, Trend, Seasonality. ETS models are also known as Exponential Smoothin State Space models. ETS models are are used for modelling how a single variable will change over time, not taking into account any other variables. ETS models differ from a simple moving average by weighting the influence of previous points on future time points based on how much time is between the two points.

ETS models are normally denoted by three letters, e.g. `ETS_AMZ`. The first letter refers to the error type, the second letter is the trend type, and the third letter is the season type. Possible letters are:

`N` = None

`A` = Additive

`M` = Multiplicative

`Z` = Automatically selected

I wouldn't worry too much about the implications of these model types for now. For this tutorial we will just pick some basic model types and compare them. If you want to read more about ETS model types, I recommend <a href="http://www.exponentialsmoothing.net" target="_blank">this book</a>.

Choosing which model to use to forecast your data can be difficult and requires your own intuition as well as looking at test statistics. To test the accuracy of a model we have to compare it to data that has not been used to generate the forecast, so let's create some data subsets from the `monthly_milk_ts` time series object, one for generating the model (`monthly_milk_model`), and one for testing the model's accuracy (`monthly_milk_test`). `window()` is a function similar to `subset()` or `filter()`, subsetting an object based on arguments, but for time series (`ts`) objects. `window()` takes the original time series object (`x`) and the `start` and `end` points of the subset, if `end` is not included, the subset extends to the end of the time series: 

```r
monthly_milk_model <- window(x = monthly_milk_ts, start=c(1962), end=c(1970))
monthly_milk_test <- window(x = monthly_milk_ts, start=c(1970))
```

Let's first compare model forecasts of different ETS models visually by extracting forecast data from `forecast` objects and plotting it in ggplot against the original data. The code below is quite long, and could be made more concise by using [pipes, or apply() functions](http://www.ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html) but this allows you to investigate all the intermediate objects for yourself, so you understand how they are structured and what they show:

```r
# Creating model objects of each type of ets model
milk_ets_auto <- ets(monthly_milk_model)
milk_ets_mmm <- ets(monthly_milk_model, model = "MMM")
milk_ets_zzz<- ets(monthly_milk_model, model = "ZZZ")
milk_ets_mmm_damped <- ets(monthly_milk_model, model = "MMM", damped = TRUE)

# Creating forecast objects
milk_ets_fc <- forecast(milk_ets_auto, h = 60)  # `h = 60` means that the forecast will be 60 time periods long, in our case a time period is one month
milk_ets_mmm_fc <- forecast(milk_ets_mmm, h = 60)
milk_ets_zzz_fc <- forecast(milk_ets_zzz, h = 60)
milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc <- forecast(milk_ets_mmm_damped, h = 60)

# Convert forecasts to data frames 
milk_ets_fc_df <- cbind("Month" = rownames(as.data.frame(milk_ets_fc)), as.data.frame(milk_ets_fc))  # Creating a data frame
names(milk_ets_fc_df) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(milk_ets_fc_df))  # Removing whitespace from column names
milk_ets_fc_df$Date <- as.Date(paste("01-", milk_ets_fc_df$Month, sep = ""), format = "%d-%b %Y")  # prepending day of month to date
milk_ets_fc_df$Model <- rep("ets")  # Adding column of model type

milk_ets_mmm_fc_df <- cbind("Month" = rownames(as.data.frame(milk_ets_mmm_fc)), as.data.frame(milk_ets_mmm_fc))
names(milk_ets_mmm_fc_df) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(milk_ets_mmm_fc_df))
milk_ets_mmm_fc_df$Date <- as.Date(paste("01-", milk_ets_mmm_fc_df$Month, sep = ""), format = "%d-%b %Y")
milk_ets_mmm_fc_df$Model <- rep("ets_mmm")

milk_ets_zzz_fc_df <- cbind("Month" = rownames(as.data.frame(milk_ets_zzz_fc)), as.data.frame(milk_ets_zzz_fc))
names(milk_ets_zzz_fc_df) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(milk_ets_zzz_fc_df))
milk_ets_zzz_fc_df$Date <- as.Date(paste("01-", milk_ets_zzz_fc_df$Month, sep = ""), format = "%d-%b %Y")
milk_ets_zzz_fc_df$Model <- rep("ets_zzz")

milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df <- cbind("Month" = rownames(as.data.frame(milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc)), as.data.frame(milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc))
names(milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df))
milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df$Date <- as.Date(paste("01-", milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df$Month, sep = ""), format = "%d-%b %Y")
milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df$Model <- rep("ets_mmm_damped")

# Combining into one data frame
forecast_all <- rbind(milk_ets_fc_df, milk_ets_mmm_fc_df, milk_ets_zzz_fc_df, milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc_df)

# Plotting with ggplot
ggplot() +
	geom_line(data = monthly_milk, aes(x = month_date, y = milk_prod_per_cow_kg)) +  # Plotting original data
	geom_line(data = forecast_all, aes(x = Date, y = Point_Forecast, colour = Model))  # Plotting model forecasts
```

<center>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/monthly_milk_fc_all.png" alt="Img">
</center>

You can also numerically compare the accuracy of different models to the data we excluded from the model training (`monthly_milk_test`) using `accuracy()`:

```r
accuracy(milk_ets_fc, monthly_milk_test)
accuracy(milk_ets_mmm_fc, monthly_milk_test)
accuracy(milk_ets_zzz_fc, monthly_milk_test)
accuracy(milk_ets_mmm_damped_fc, monthly_milk_test)
```

This outputs a whole load of different statistics in tables like the one below: 

```
                      ME      RMSE      MAE         MPE      MAPE      MASE       ACF1 Theil's U
Training set -0.06896592  2.723633 2.087071 -0.02713133 0.6737187 0.2182860 0.02707694        NA
Test set      6.12353156 10.633503 8.693532  1.58893810 2.3165456 0.9092534 0.82174403 0.4583252
```

Let's pick apart those statistics:

`ME`: Mean Error, the mean difference between modelled and observed values 

`RMSE`: Root Mean Squared Error, Take each difference between the model and the observed values, square it, take the mean, then square root it. 

`MAE`: Mean Absolute Error, The same as `ME`, but all errors are transformed to positive values, so positive and negative errors don't cancel each other out.

`MPE`: Mean Percentage Error, Similar to `ME`, but each error is expressed as a percentage of the forecast estimate. Percentage Errors are not scale dependent, so can be used to compare forecast accuracy between datasets. 

`MAPE`: Mean Absolute Percentage Error, The same as `MPE`, but all errors are transformed to positive values, so positive and negative errors don't cancel each other out.

`MASE`: Mean Absolute Scaled Error, Compares the `MAE` of the forecast with the `MAE` produced by a naive forecast. A naive forecast is one which simply projects a straight line into the future the value of which is the final value of the time series. A `MASE>1` tells us that the naive forecast fit the observed data better than the model, while a `MASE<1` tells us that the model was better than the naive model.

`ACF1`: Auto-Correlation Function at lag 1, How correlated are data points with data points directly after them. `ACF = 1` means points are fully correlated, `ACF = 0` means points are not at all correlated.

`Theil's U`: Compares the forecast with results from a model using minimal data. Errors are squared to give more weight to large errors. A `U<1` means the forecast is better than guessing, a `U>1` means the forecast is worse than guessing.

`MAPE` is the most commonly used measure of forecast accuracy, probably due to it being easy to understand conceptually. However, `MAPE` becomes highly skewed when observations are close to zero and infinite when observations equal zero, making it unsuitable for some time series that have report values. `MAPE` also gives a heavier penalty to positive deviations than negative deviations. `MASE` is suggested here as an alternative which avoids the shortcomings of `MAPE`, while remaining interpretable. If you're really keen, have a read of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222665190_Another_look_at_measures_of_forecast_accuracy" target="_blank">Hyndman & Koehler 2006</a> or <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c1eb/b2eb69ec8a9615a8d8b705ebbc4fc126c370.pdf" target="_blank">Franses 2016</a> for more on `MASE` and the potential shortcomings of all these proxies for model accuracy. 

`Training set` denotes values that were gathered from comparing the forecast to the data that was used to generate the forecast (notice how the Mean Error (`ME`) is very small)

`Test set` denotes values that were gathered from comparing the forecast to the test data which we deliberately excluded when training the forecast.

By comparing the MAPE and MASE statistics of the four models in the `Test set` row, we can see that the `monthly_milk_ets_fc` and `monthly_milk_ets_zzz_fc` models have the lowest values, and looking at the graphs for this forecast and comparing it visually to the test data we can see that this is the forecast which best matches the test data. So we can use that forecast to project into the future. 

This was only a very simple forecast. More complex forecasts use multiple variables and meaningful interaction terms to make more accurate and precise predictions. 

#### Extracting values from a forecast
Now that we have identified the best forecast model(s), we can use these models to find out what milk production will be like in the year 1975! Use the code below to extract a predicted value for a given year from our forecasts. This is as simple as subsetting the forecast data frame to extract the correct value. I'm using functions from the [`dplyr` package, with pipes (`%>%`),](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/16/piping.html) but you could use any other method of subsetting, such as the `[]` square bracket method using base R:

```r
milk_ets_fc_df %>%
	filter(Month=="Jan 1975") %>%
	select(Month, Point_Forecast)

milk_ets_zzz_fc_df %>%
	filter(Month=="Jan 1975") %>%
	select(Month, Point_Forecast)
```

### Coding challenge

Now that you have worked through the tutorial, use what you have learnt to make some model forecasts and plot some graphs to investigate temporal patterns for our data on CO2 concentrations on Mauna Loa, Hawaii. See if you can predict the CO2 concentration for June 2050. You can find the data in `co2_loa.csv` in the folder you downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC-time-series" target="_blank">the github repository</a>.
