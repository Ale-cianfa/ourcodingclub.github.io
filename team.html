            <h2>Gergana Daskalova</h2>
          <p>I am a recent BSc Ecological and Environmental Sciences graduate with a research focus in conservation in the face of man-driven land use change. In particular, I am interested in agro-ecology, landscape ecology, conservation policy and the potential of abandoned agricultural land for biodiversity conservation. I am absolutely fascinated by the power of good education in helping people reach and exceed their potential and dream big – my own dream is to become a lecturer and researcher at least as inspirational and empowering as the mentors that I have been fortunate to have so far. </p>

            <h2>John Godlee</h2>
          <p> I am a graduate from the University of Edinburgh with a focus on tropical forest ecology and species interactions. I’m currently employed as a research assistant and hope to start a PhD soon! I have experience in designing sustainable projects through my work in nature conservation and as the student representative for the Edinburgh University School of GeoSciences. I have some experience using R for statistical modelling, R-markdown to make reproducible scripts and I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia.</p>

            <h2>Joe Boyle</h2>
          <p>I’m a fourth-year ecology student, looking for ways to improve my R skills without having to read books about it alone in a darkened room. I've been a member of Team Shrub since November 2014, including the 2015 field season, from which I gained direct experience of scientific practice, including some coding. I’ve been trying to practice R whenever I can, but it’s difficult to know the what’s possible of myself and the software without some outside help. Considering how important R is for modern ecology, this course should give me some of the skills I need to improve both my final year’s work, and anything beyond.</p>

            <h2>Eleanor Walker</h2>
          <p>I am currently in my fourth year studying Ecological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Having proficient coding skills promises to become of more importance as I enter my final year. In particular, to aid with independent research projects such as my dissertation. Being a class representative for my degree programme has given me the opportunity to talk to peers about potential ways to increase student support in this area. Joining a research expedition this summer lead by Dr Isla Myers-Smith has taught me valuable techniques such as; technical expertise, data analysis and ethics in the field, while enabling me to work with a team of scientist who are experts in their field.</p>

            <h2>Sandra Angers-Blondin</h2>
          <p>I am a third year PhD student investigating the responses of tundra vegetation to climate change in the Arctic, and the role of plant-plant interactions in modifying these responses. I have been using statistical programming since the beginning of my PhD and am therefore very familiar with the R language. I have experience teaching coding to undergraduate students as a demonstrator on the course “Ecological and Environmental Analysis”. I am excited to be part of this project, as I wish a similar opportunity had been available when I started teaching myself programming. </p>

            <h2>Haydn Thomas</h2>
          <p>I’m a third year PhD student investigating the causes and consequences of vegetation change in the tundra biome. My research requires a range of coding tools and software, from using GitHub repositories to hierarchical Bayesian modelling (which I still haven’t quite grasped yet!). I had never even used R before starting my PhD, so a course like this earlier on in my research career would have been immensely valuable – this is a great opportunity to pass on the skills I have learnt onto others. I have a large amount of teaching experience, both as a tutor for Masters and Undergraduate course and as a demonstrator in previous statistics classes, and have been previously nominated for a teaching award.</p>

            <h2>Pedro Miranda</h2>
          <p>I'm a PhD student investigating the main floristic patterns and their environmental drivers in Lowland Tropical South America and how these patterns will change due to climate change. Through my project, I gained experience in handling large quantities of data in R, as well as in using different R packages and clustering methods. I began to consistently use this software in my research when I started my PhD and, because of this, I see how valuable an initiative such as Coding Club is for students and young researchers who want/need to acquire coding and data management skills in R.  </p>
