            <h2>Gergana Daskalova</h2>
          <p>I am a recent BSc Ecological and Environmental Sciences graduate with a research focus in conservation in the face of man-driven land use change. In particular, I am interested in agro-ecology, landscape ecology, conservation policy and the potential of abandoned agricultural land for biodiversity conservation. I am absolutely fascinated by the power of good education in helping people reach and exceed their potential and dream big – my own dream is to become a lecturer and researcher at least as inspirational and empowering as the mentors that I have been fortunate to have so far. </p>

            <h2>Joe Boyle</h2>
          <p>I am a a fourth-year EES student, who’s looking for ways to improve his R skills without having to read books about it alone in a darkened room. I've had great experiences with staff-student collaboration, having been a class rep for the duration of my degree, and sitting on college- and university-wide committees including the ELIR and academic senate. Most importantly, I've been a member of Team Shrub since November 2014, including the 2015 field season, from which I gained direct experience of scientific practice, including some coding.</p>

            <h2>Eleanor Walker</h2>
          <p>I am currently in my fourth year studying Ecological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Having proficient coding skills promises to become of more importance as I enter my final year. In particular, to aid with independent research projects such as my dissertation. Being a class representative for my degree programme has given me the opportunity to talk to peers about potential ways to increase student support in this area. Joining a research expedition this summer lead by Dr Isla Myers-Smith has taught me valuable techniques such as; technical expertise, data analysis and ethics in the field, while enabling me to work with a team of scientist who are experts in their field.</p>

            <h2>Haydn Thomas</h2>
          <p>I’m a third year PhD student investigating the causes and consequences of vegetation change in the tundra biome. My research requires a range of coding tools and software, from using GitHub repositories to hierarchical Bayesian modelling (which I still haven’t quite grasped yet!). I had never even used R before starting my PhD, so a course like this earlier on in my research career would have been immensely valuable – this is a great opportunity to pass on the skills I have learnt onto others. I have a large amount of teaching experience, both as a tutor for Masters and Undergraduate course and as a demonstrator in previous statistics classes, and have been previously nominated for a teaching award.</p>

            <h2>Dr Isla Myers-Smith</h2>
          <p>Dr Isla Myers-Smith  is a senior lecturer in the Ecological and Environmental Sciences Programme at the University of Edinburgh and winner of the EUSA teaching award for innovative assessment for the course Conservation Science.  She works with large-scale ecological data to understand global change in tundra ecosystems and biodiversity change across the globe. She is particularly interested in how to encourage the development of quantitative skills to keep up with the rapid advances in statistics and programming in the field of ecology.</p>

            <h2>Dr Kyle Dexter</h2>
          <p>Kyle Dexter is a Lecturer in Plant Ecology at the University of Edinburgh and a Research Associate at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Much of his teaching focuses on statistics, at the undergraduate, masters and Ph.D. levels, while he also teaches forest ecology and a field course on plant and invertebrate identification. His research focuses on large-scale eco-evolutionary studies of tropical plants. He completed his Ph.D. in the USA and a postdoctoral fellowship in France prior to moving to the UK and thus has experience with a variety of pedagogical environments.</p>
