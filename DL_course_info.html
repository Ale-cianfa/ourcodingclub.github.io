            <h2>3. Download the course materials</h2>
          <p>If you want to tackle a whole course stream (or most of it), we recommend that you download the relevant data repository from GitHub (no account required) and place it somewhere near the root of your computer (e.g. the "C" drive). That way, you have all the materials you need already in a clear folder structure.</p>
          <ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_stream1" target="_blank" style="font-size:18px;">Data repository for Stream 1: Stats from Scratch</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_stream2" target="_blank" style="font-size:18px;">Data repository for Stream 2: Wiz of Data Viz</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ourcodingclub/CC_course_stream3" target="_blank" style="font-size:18px;">Data repository for Stream 3: Mastering Modelling</a></li>
          </ul><br>
          
   <p>If you only plan on doing a couple of tutorials, then you may ignore this step and download the materials directly from the link provided in each tutorial.</p>
          
        </div>

   </div>
   
   <div class="row">
      <p>You can then access the files in RStudio by setting your working directory to a specific folder, or by creating a new R project within the desired folder (which will automatically set the working directory). We suggest that you save your new script and all other outputs from the tutorial (e.g. graphs) in that tutorial folder (e.g. your script for the first tutorial would be saved as <i>C://CC_course_stream1/01_Getting_started/my-script.R</i>). </p>
      
      <p>No idea what we're talking about? The <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/13/intro-to-r.html" target="_blank">very first tutorial</a> of <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/course/stats-scratch.html" target="_blank">Stats from Scratch</a> should demystify all this.</p>

            <h2>4. Learn!</h2>
          <p>Now you're all set to start working on the tutorials! You can find the list of tutorials <b>on each stream page</b>, along with the links to related quizzes and challenges.</p>
          
         <p>An average tutorial takes around <b>two hours</b> to complete, although some may be longer or shorter. Make sure you save your script often as you go, so you can pick up where you left off if you don't finish a tutorial in one sitting. Our <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2016/11/13/intro-to-r.html" target="_blank">Intro to R</a> and <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html" target="_blank">Coding Etiquette</a> tutorials will tell you more about managing your code and scripts properly.</p>
          
         <p>When you work on the tutorials, we recommend that you have RStudio open in one window with your script and the tutorial data, and follow along the tutorial online in another window.</p>
         
        <p><b>Test yourself!</b> When you finish a tutorial, go to our <a href="https://coding-club.shinyapps.io/test-centre/" target="_blank">Test Centre</a> to take the associated quiz. The quizzes are short and their purpose is for you to recap concepts you have learned, and for us to verify that you have engaged with the tutorial. Remember, we're not here to catch you out! Still, better to take the test right after the tutorial, while everything is still fresh.</p> 
        
        <p><b>Do as few or as many tutorials as you like. This course runs continuously so there is no start or end date, and no time limit - ideal for learning alongside your many other commitments!</b> When you request a certificate, all the tutorials and challenges you have completed will be listed on it.</p>

            <h2>5. Challenge yourself</h2>
          <p>We offer three data challenges as the culmination of each course stream. <b>In these challenges, we give you various research questions to answer, using real-life, open-source data from Scottish environmental organisations.</b> The challenges are meant to be, well, challenging (!), and therefore we only provide minimal guidance. It will be up to you to make decisions and get creative with your code - there are usually more than one valid way of getting to an answer! </p>
          <br>
          <p>You don't need to have done every tutorial in a stream to succeed in the challenge, but you might want to refer back to them for reminders or useful snippets of code. Remember also that search engines are your friend and you are encouraged to look things up! Like with the tutorials, we test your completion of the challenge with a set of questions, with the difference that these questions are already made available to you on the challenge page. </p>
          <br>
         <p><b>Each challenge will probably take you anywhere between 3-8 hours to complete.</b> Don't get frustrated if you get stuck somewhere: take a break, ask a friend or colleague for help, or get in touch with us. We want you to have fun and feel empowered: after all, you've worked hard and learned a lot! </p>

      <h3>What is the Coding Club?</h3>
          <p>Our Coding Club started in 2016 when a few students in Environmental and Ecological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh decided they wanted to learn more computer programming and quantitative methods that they were being taught in class. They received funding to create coding tutorials and run weekly workshops that rapidly became a success.</p>
          
          <p>Our Coding Club workshops are a relaxed and fun learning environment for undergraduate students, postgraduates, and staff alike, but our impact reaches far beyond Edinburgh. Users worlwide access our tutorials, and other universities have created their own coding clubs based on our model.</p>
          
    <h3>Why a course?</h3>
          <p>We created the course to offer a semi-structured approach to learning programming. Instead of lectures, we rely on practical problem-solving with our acclaimed tutorials, which are designed with clear and measurable learning objectives in mind. Similarly, we designed the course streams to progressively build up your skills and develop a toolkit suited to your studies or professional requirements. You will rapidly gain confidence as you tackle increasingly complex and varied datasets and tasks.</p>  
          
          <p>We strongly believe that <b>anyone</b> can code and pride ourselves on offering a highly flexible and <b>free course</b> so that you can participate regardless of your occupation or financial situation. Our tutorials are written by a very diverse <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/team/" target="_blank">team</a> and we want to see that diversity represented in the next generation of environmental data scientists!</p>
          
          <p>We are able to provide this course completely free of charge thanks to the support of <a href="https://www.thedatalab.com/" target="_blank">the Data Lab</a>, Scotland's Innovation Centre for data and AI.</p>
