      <h2>Challenge outline and objectives</h2>
      <p>While Scotland is best known for its endless rolling heather hills, it used to be covered in wide swathes of forest. Less than 20% of Scotland is now afforested, and only 4% of the territory consists of native woodlands (<a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/about-us/where-we-work/scotland/" target="_blank">Woodland Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/land-and-sea-management/managing-land/forests-and-woodlands/woodland-expansion-across-scotland" target="_blank">Scottish Natural Heritage</a>). </p>
      
      <p>The Scottish government has included woodland expansion goals in its Climate Change plan, and several governmental and non governmental organisations are working towards the creation of new woodlands that will support native species and provide a wider range of ecosystem services than just timber. </p>
      
      <p>You have been asked to provide a report on the extent and structure of some high-priority conservation habitats in national nature reserves (NNR) of Scotland. For selected woodland types, you are required to prepare maps of their distribution in the Cairngorms, the Glen Affric, and the Trossachs nature reserve areas. You have also been tasked to calculate their respective extent within the reserve boundaries, and some basic biodiversity indices.<p>

          <p> You will use the following datasets, available from the Challenge repository (LINK) on GitHub <br> </p>
          
          <b><h3>Native Woodland Survey of Scotland</h3></b>
          
          <li><b>FCPRODUCT S NWSS</b>, a shapefile of all woodland patches in Scotland. The most important variables in the dataset are: <ul>
             <li>- <b>DOM_HABITA</b>: the main habitat type for the polygon. We will only keep some priority habitats, listed in the specific tasks (INTERNAL LINK)</li>
             <li>- <b>HECTARES</b>: the area of a given patch</li>
