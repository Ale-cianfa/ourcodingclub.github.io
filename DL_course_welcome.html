          <p><b>Scientists in environmental fields increasingly need strong data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation skills, but are not always taught data science in their degrees. Our online course is made by ecologists, for ecologists, and focuses on giving you the skills you need for your studies or career. </b> Depending on your chosen path, you will learn to use R to manipulate, graph and analyse ecological data, or build on your existing skills to create advanced data visualisations or master new analysis techniques such as mixed-effect modelling, ordination, etc.  </p>
<p><br>By the end of the course, you will be able to undertake one (or more) of our case-study challenges, using open data to answer questions about Scottish environmental issues, giving you a flavour of real-life applications of data science.

            <h2>Is this course for me?</h2>
          <p><b>We think so - it's for everyone!</b> Our course is predominantly aimed at environmental scientists wishing to improve their programming and quantitative skills. That said, anyone with an interest in coding and data science can participate! It just means that our examples are drawn from nature (we are proud tree-huggers), and the tutorials are focused on answering ecological questions (but most techniques also apply in other disciplines like social sciences). 
</p><br>
            <h2>What's special about this course?</h2>
          <p>Our course is designed to give you the data science skills you want and need. As such, we propose three different streams aimed at different interests and levels of ability. However, the set-up of our course is highly flexible, so that you can pick and choose from each stream to create your own learning path, 100% tailored to your needs. At the end, it is the tutorials and challenges that you have completed, rather than the course stream, that will appear on your certificate. <b>Oh, and itâ€™s completely free!</b> </p> <br>

<h2>How it works <i>(add links once pages are up)</i></h2>

<p>First, have a look at our course streams and their associated tutorials below. You can decide to do a full stream, or handpick tutorials you want to do across streams. </p>

<p>Once you know what you want to do, you can sign up and download the course materials. We host everything on a <a href= "http://github.com/" target="_blank"> GitHub</a> platform and use open data from environmental organisation, so everything is free and openly accessible. The "Let's Get Started" button below will take you to a page with all the information to sign up and download the data repositories.</p>

<p>Start doing the tutorials! Each stream has a dedicated page with links to the relevant tutorials (click the banners above). You follow along, entering code in your own console, and of course we also encourage you to experiment and try things for yourself! Each tutorial ends with a challenge that will test your new skills (example solution provided), and a short quiz to record your successful completion of the tutorial. </p>

<p>We also have three case-study data challenges that we encourage participants to do after completing the course. That's where the fun is really at, as you'll get to use all of your new skills to creatively answer some questions about environmental issues, using real-life data! </p>

<p>We record all the individual tutorials and challenges you do during the course. When you have completed everything you want, you can request and download your certificate.</p>
